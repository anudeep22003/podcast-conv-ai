Who in the year 2001 will\nbe the same age as I am now. Maybe he will be better adjusted to this\nkind of world that you're trying to portray. The big difference,\nwhen he grows up... In fact, if we wanted to\nwait till the year 2001... He will have in his own house not a computer as big as\nthis, but at least a console through which he can talk to\nhis friendly local computer and get all the information\nhe needs for his everyday life, like his bank statements,\nhis theater reservations, all the information you need in the course\nof living in a complex modern society. This will be in a compact\nform in his own house. He'll have a television screen,\nlike these here, and a keyboard. And he'll talk to the computer\nand get information from it. And he'll take it as much for\ngranted as we take the telephone. I wonder, though, what sort of\na life would it be like in social terms? I mean, if our whole life\nis built around the computer, do we become a computer-dependent society? In some ways, but they\nwill also enrich our society because it will make it possible for\nus to live, really, anywhere we like. Any businessman and executive\ncould live almost anywhere on Earth and still do his business\nthrough a device like this. And this is a wonderful thing. It means\nwe won't have to be stuck in cities. We'll be able to live out in the\ncountry or wherever we please. Screen says it's\nan unimplemented trap. But the error code is\nwrong. It's a system error. - So what's the upshot?\n- It's not gonna say hello. It absolutely\nis gonna say hello. - It's nobody's fault. It's a system error.\n- You built the voice demo. - The voice demo is flaky.\n- Keep your voices down. I've been telling you that\nfor... This thing is overbuilt. It worked last night. It\nworked the night before that. It worked three hours ago. - It's not working now, so just skip over the voice demo.\n- Fuck you. - Everything else is working.\n- Shh. Skip over the voice demo. We need it to say hello. - You're not hearing me. It's not going to say hello.\n- Just fix it. - Fix it?\n- Yeah. - In 40 minutes?\n- Fix it. - I can't.\n- Who's the person who can? I'm the person who can, and I can't. - How bad are you saying?\n- It's pretty bad. - I don't know what that means.\n- It means the demo is more than likely gonna crash. You have to keep your voices down. Joel Pforzheimer is\nsitting out in the house. I don't care if... Who's Joel Pforzheimer? GQ. He's been shadowing you\nfor a week. Did you notice? Just look like everything's fine. He's sitting out in the house. Hey. What are you guys saying? Some kind of race condition, but we\nhaven't been able to track it down yet. Is the synthesizer sampling fast enough? No, so the rates are off\nand it keeps crashing. It's 20 seconds out of a\ntwo-hour launch. Why not just cut it? - We can't cut it.\n- Yeah, you just cut it. Two days ago, we ran a Super Bowl ad that\ncould've won the Oscar for Best Short Film. There are more people who can tell you about\nthe ad than can tell you who won the game. I understand, but the ad said\nthe Mac was gonna save the world. It didn't say it was gonna say hello. We open the house in five. Don't open the house. We're taking a quick break. - Part of the problem is...\n- What? We can recompile, but if it's a hardware\nproblem, we can't get into the back. Why not? - Do you wanna tell her or should I?\n- Don't start with me, man. - Why can't he get into the machine?\n- You need special tools. What kind of special tools?\nJust take a screwdriver. He didn't want users to be able to open it. You need special tools. Is this for real? There are a hundred engineers walking\naround here. None of them have the tools? In fairness, not many of\nthem were issued the tools. - What about you?\n- I left them at the office. It was 3:00 AM when I... Oh, Jesus Christ. - Cut \"Hello.\"\n- No. - What's the first rule of a launch?\n- It's not gonna crash. It just did. Andy! Which one? The other Andy. You're right\nthere. Why would I be calling out? - He needs to talk to you.\n- Yeah. The exit signs need to be off or\nwe're not gonna get a full blackout. - We've spoken to the building manager and the fire marshal.\n- And? There's no way they're gonna\nlet us turn the exit signs off. I'll pay whatever the fine is. The fine is they're gonna come\nin and tell everyone to leave. You explained to the fire marshal\nthat we're in here changing the world? I did, but unless we can also change\nthe properties of fire, he doesn't care. - Steve...\n- If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits, it'll have been well worth\nit for those who survive. For those who don't, less\nso, but still pretty good. - Look, I...\n- I need it to go black. Real black. Get rid of the exit signs and\ndon't let me know how you did it.

Ten years later they'll\nbe the information company, and that's very bad for the human race. So we don't have time to\nbe polite or realistic, 'cause if we are, this\ncompany's next product launch will be held in front of 26 people and a stringer from the\nAlameda County Shopper's Guide. We haven't advertised the voice software. We could pull it out of the demo\nand no one would be disappointed. Do you want to try being reasonable, just, you know, see what it feels like? Okay. Pull the voice demo. Thank you. And then cancel the launch. I see. You just tricked me a little. You can tell me how unimportant it is,\nbut if the computer doesn't say hello, then neither will John Sculley,\nwho I promise you agrees with me. Sculley's not gonna cancel the\nlaunch 'cause he's not insane. He's also not a hack, and\nwhen it comes to the Macintosh, he's gonna do what I ask him to do. - What's in this box?\n- Nothing you need to worry about. Don't even open it. What the fuck? Why is there a carton of... Who did this? - Somebody thought...\n- Who? Doesn't matter. Thought it would be a good\nidea to have copies of that Time cover available at everyone's seat. It was nipped in the bud and all the\ncopies are being taken out of the building. So problem solved. - This isn't a Macintosh.\n- I understand. Somebody thought it would\nbe a good idea to, like, enthusiastically hand over copies of\nTime with a not-a-Macintosh on the cover at the launch of the Macintosh? What are they handing\nout at Hewlett-Packard? A bushel of apples with my face on them? I'm sure the thinking was that\nsince the computer is Man of the Year that that's good for our business, but like I said, I'm having\nthem removed from the building. What I'd like you to do with them\nis to take them, all 2,600 copies, and stack them on Kottke's desk and tell him Steve says,\n\"Happy New Year to you.\" Okay. I gave Time magazine full access. The whole campus: Bandley, Apple II, Lisa. I gave him Sculley, Markkula. I\ngave him Woz. I gave him everybody. What should I call the person who thought\nit'd be a good idea to hand these out? I'm not telling you who it was. It was done without malice.\nIt's been taken care of. You have a half hour and we\nhave things to talk about. Like what? Like a million\nin the first 90 days. - Joanna...\n- 20,000 a month after that. - Look. Those are the forecasts.\n- I'm begging... This is my field. I'm begging you\nto manage expectations out there. - I'm fanning expectations.\n- We're not gonna sell a million in the first 90 days. Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone is waiting for the Mac. Maybe. But what happens when they\nfind out that for 2,495, there's nothing you can do with it? We were competitive at $1,500, but once you replaced the\nMotorola 6809 with the 68000... Which is what supports menus, windows,\npoint and click, high-res graphics... Yeah, 'cause everyone needs\nrectangles with rounded corners. Coach lands on the runway at the\nexact same time as first class. I don't have the first\nfucking idea what that means, but this is how it got to $2,500, which is the price point on\nthe PC, which can do a lot more! Who's gonna want a PC?\nWhat idiot is gonna want... If I wanna tell you there's a spot\non your shirt, I point to the spot. I don't say there's a spot 14\ncentimeters down from the collar and three centimeters to the\nright of the second button while I try to remember what\nthe command is for club soda. That's not how a person's mind works. If the goal was ease of use, maybe\nyou should've given it some memory. You can complain about memory\nor you can complain about price, but you can't do both at the same time. Memory is what costs money. I'm glad you're telling me\nyour feelings about the Mac now because we have a half hour left. We can redesign it. I'm just asking you to manage expectations. Look at their faces\nwhen they see what it is. They won't know what they're\nlooking at or why they like it, but they'll know they want it. Not instantly. When people\nheard Rite of Spring, they tore the chairs out of the theater. They didn't buy the record. Rite of Spring happens\nto be the most revolutionary and provocative symphony\nof the last century. Ballet. It was a ballet. But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he\nwas gonna sell 20,000 units a month. I don't know why we're\ntalking about Stravinsky when what I care about is Dan Kottke\nsodomizing me in Time magazine. Look. Obviously... Let me say this to you.

They've been sitting in the back of\nthe auditorium since 7:00 this morning. I'm not having a session\nwith Chrisann right now. We issued 335 press\ncredentials for the launch.

You're gonna stay here. What? No. I'm not. No. There's less of a chance of a\nscene if you stay here. She'll be cool. I find all this\nexcruciatingly personal and-and... I-I'm... I'm not staying. No. Come on. I don't wanna be in a\nroom alone with Chrisann. This is me and you. Fine. Hey. Steve. This is a surprise. Why don't you come on in? Thank you. - You coming too?\n- Yes, I'm not gonna leave her in the hallway. Okay. It's a safe hallway, but anyway. You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's\nthe head of marketing for the Mac. Good to see you. Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa. We've met before, and you told\nme you like the way I talk, and that was my favorite\nthing anyone's ever said to me. - You're from Poland.\n- Yes, I am. - Do you know where that is?\n- The top of the Earth. I think you're thinking of the North Pole. Well, we're a little\npressed for time, so... - I'll leave you guys alone.\n- Why do you wanna leave when you just said... I'm gonna check in with Hertzfeld. We're trying to get a\ncomputer to say hello, but right now it's being very shy. Would you come help me? Is that okay? Sure. Thank you. My dad named a computer after me. I'm not your... Actually, do you know what\na coincidence is, Lisa? No. Like if you met someone. You made a new friend\nand her name was Lisa too. That would be a coincidence. \"Lisa\" stands for \"Local\nIntegrated Systems Architecture.\" L-I-S-A. It's a coincidence. - You about done?\n- Yeah. Okay. Come. Let's make that computer say hi. Go ahead, Lisa. So it was the other way around. I was named after the computer? Nothing was named after\nanybody. It's a coincidence. Come on. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? Why\nare you telling her these things? Why are you still telling\nher I'm her father? - A judge told her you're her father.\n- No, he didn't. Where the hell do you get off\ntelling Time magazine I've slept with 28 percent\nof the men in America? - That's not...\n- Where do you get off? That's not remotely what I said. It's right here.

I am quoting...\n- I didn't invent math. \"...twenty-eight percent of\nthe male population of the United States could be the father.\" I wasn't saying you've slept\nwith 28% of American men.

The disk fits in your pocket. I need a shirt with a breast\npocket. I can take it out onstage. - A shirt?\n- The disk! I need a white shirt in my\nsize with a breast pocket. Yes. Which one of the no\nstores that are open at 8:45 do you want me to have someone run\nto and return from in 15 minutes? Go out in the lobby, find someone\nmy size who's wearing a white shirt. Tell them I'll trade\nthem for a free computer, and they get to keep my shirt. Does it have to be a\nwhite shirt? Is blue okay? No. The Mac is beige, I'm beige, the\ndisk is blue, the shirt has to be white. Andy? Hello, I'm Macintosh. Bring me the head of Andy Hertzfeld. I tried to get it to\nsay hello, but it's shy. Yeah. So that's it? That's it. I don't get it. I know. What are people going to do with it? Lisa, how old are you now? - You know how old she is.\n- How old are you, Lisa? Five. Come sit here for a minute.
