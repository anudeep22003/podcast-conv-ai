It explains that fundraising is not glamorous, and that it is a grind of one-on-one meetings. It also explains the advantages of using the Y Combinator Simple Agreement for Equity (SAFE) to raise money for a startup, such as how SAFEs are easy to understand, fast to close, and don't require legal fees. It also explains how SAFEs give founders more control over their companies than ever before, and how raising money with SAFEs can give founders more leverage when talking to investors. Lastly, it explains how even if investors reject a startup, it doesn't mean it's a bad startup, and provides an example of a company that was rejected over 50 times before getting its first check.",

                "text": "foreign [Music] I'm Brad Flora I'm a group partner here at YC and I'm going to be talking about how startup fundraising works today like I said I'm a group partner at YC and what that means is that I read applications I interview the startups that apply and then I work with them to try to make something people want and one of the topics that people ask about all the time at YC is fundraising in fact it's probably the thing that we get asked about more often than anything else and the reason for that is because as Paul Graham wrote years ago raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup after making something people want so let's take a quick tour of all the awesome stuff that YC's put out about fundraising over the years first there's the Paul Graham essays he wrote the fundraising Survival Guide how to fund a startup how to convince investors to invest in your company and even wrote a great essay about understanding investor herd Dynamics all of the stuff's online you can see the links below you should check it out years later just a little bit ago YC president Jeff Ralston posted a terrific guide to raising a seed round where he covers everything from start to finish that you need to know the Nitty Gritty on how to raise a seed round and he gave a great video presentation at startup School a few years ago where he presented that material it's on YouTube you should check it out it'll tell you how to raise a seed round finally we've posted a lot of tactical guides about specific aspects of fundraising how to build a seed deck how to pitch your startup how to get meetings with investors and how to raise money online for startups using platforms like Angel list we've even got something about the different types of investors and their incentives so if you really want to get specific and drill into stuff there's content for you that you can find what I didn't want to do today is just rehash all of that stuff because it's already out there what I wanted to do instead is talk about some of the misconceptions and myths that we see as YC Partners when we work with Founders Founders out there are consuming all sorts of information in the media and a lot of it is about startup fundraising and there's some things in there that just are not true that we're going to talk about the goal of this talk is to catch you up on how fundraising actually works today and we're going to do that by exploring seven fundraising myths and for each one of them we're going to talk about the myth the reality behind the myth and then look at some great YC companies that bust that myth before we get started just a little bit more about me I'm a YC partner but I've also been on both sides of the table as a founder and an investor from 2008 to 2014 I was building startups and the company that I got the most success was perfect audience which was an ad retargeting startup for small businesses I took perfect audience through the YC summer 11 batch 11 years ago and we raised a million dollar seed round after demo day I hired a bunch of great people we grew to three million dollars in revenue and we were acquired in 2014. after that acquisition I got really into investing in startups it started with Angel Investing where I was writing just a few checks five thousand dollars ten thousand dollars into YC companies that I thought sounded really cool at demo day but I got hooked the thrill of going and meeting Founders finding out what their deal is trying to figure out are they making something people want should I invest was too much for me and suddenly I was raising a fund with some friends to scale up and invest in even more YC companies and so through that fund I invested in 150 YC companies and the good news for my backers is that we got into some great companies you may have heard of a few of them deal open C retool razor pay it was really awesome to help those companies raise their first round funding and it's been a lot of fun being involved since eventually though I joined YC as a group partner and I get to do both sides I get act as a Founder as a fellow peer to the YC Founders and help them figure out how to make something people want and then use my investor experience to help them figure out how to raise money so I've got a good view of this I've been involved in a lot of seed fundraising so let's get started with these myths and for the first one I want to talk about is this idea that raising money is glamorous what's the image in your head that you think of when you think of startup fundraising for a lot of you it might be something like this this is an image of Shark Tank and it's a television show where entrepreneurs they dress up they make a sign they get a bunch of materials and they pitch a bunch of investors at once called sharks and these are a bunch of people of varying levels of investor expertise who hear the pitch ask a bunch of uh nosy kind of pushy questions and then fire offers that the founder rapid fire and so if you watch this you may be thinking gosh I've gotta put a whole presentation together like this and I'm gonna pitch a bunch of people and they're going to ask me all these tough questions and it's",

                "text": "nation that I've got to figure out the reality is that fundraising actually looks like this this is a picture taken in the creamery which is a now departed Cafe in San Francisco notice what's happening here it's just a bunch of people sitting in chairs talking quietly amongst themselves right it's just a bunch of coffee chats that's how fundraising actually looks that's what it actually feels like is just sitting in a cafe talking to someone Shark Tank the pitch competitions the business plan competitions they're just for show they're marketing events for the organizations that put them on and in fact a lot of the investors at these things they don't invest they're just there to meet other investors and hang out and even on Shark Tank I think Mark Cuban recently said that even though he's put 20 million dollars into these companies he hasn't made a dime yet he's still in the red actual fundraising is just a bunch of one-on-one meetings on Zoom over and over again while you try to collect checks and convince investors It's a Grind okay what you see here is a diagram that was made by an actual YC company called fresh paint that shows what an actual round of fundraising looked like for their startup you see at the top the company in each one of these circles and squares represents a different investor that they met with and when the boxes are connected it's because that investor made an introduction for them they met with 160 investors and 39 of them said yes which is a very high conversion rate but the check range was all over the place they had people write 5K checks and people write 200k checks all right not everybody with some fancy VC they could write a giant check and it took them four months and 18 days to get through all these meetings and close all these deals and that was to raise 1.6 million dollars fundraising was painful and it was a grind but it was pretty straightforward it was just a bunch of conversations they've written a great blog post that's where this image comes from that you can check out should definitely read it so great example of what it's actually like to raise money okay the next myth I want to talk about is this idea that I need to raise money before I can start working on my startup all right we see this a lot with Founders we meet people that have a big idea which is great and the next thought they have is well gosh I guess I need to raise money so I can build my big idea but that's not how the best Founders actually think about fundraising the best Founders they build the first version of the product first even if it's a simple almost toy-like version of it and then they go get some users for it and then only then when they see that people are starting to use it and maybe there's some value being created do they start thinking about raising money and the reason for this is that it's cheaper than ever to build a prototype of a product to build a first version okay it's cheaper than ever to host a website and and build software it gets easier and easier and easier every year and also it's easier than ever to find potential users you can get users on platforms like product hunt on Hacker News you can find users on social media Twitter LinkedIn everybody's on the internet today and you can use that to find early people to try out your product and when you do this when you've got a little bit of product just a little bit and a few users for it it immediately gives you a great deal of Leverage all right you've gone from that person waving the pitch deck around trying to figure out how to find 20 million dollars to someone whose startup is in motion and investors want to jump on trains that are in motion here's an example solugen is a YC company from the winter 17 batch and they are a chemical manufacturing startup they literally make chemicals and sell them as you can imagine that is a capital intensive business it requires a lot of money to build a facility that can make chemicals and sell them at scale and a certain type of founder that had this idea would then make a pitch deck and go around telling investors I need 10 million dollars I need 20 million dollars to build the menu manufacturing plant to make these chemicals the solution folks chose a different path which is first they built a tiny version of their reactor that fit on a desk but it worked next they built a slightly larger version of that that could actually make enough hydrogen peroxide to sell and they took that to YC when they applied for the winter 17 batch and during the batch they started making enough hydrogen peroxide using this slightly larger version of the machine that they could go and sell it to First customers turned out that hot tub supply stores needed hydrogen peroxide to sell the people that add hot tubs and so they were making ten thousand dollars a month selling hydrogen peroxide to hot tub supply stores not a ton of money but let's step back for a second if you were an investor and you were trying to invest in a chemical Manufacturing Company who would you back the person with the pitch deck asking for 20 million dollars or the people that have built a first version of this even if it's small and making small amounts of the product and selling it to hot tub",

                "text": "business but it's something well investors clearly want the second Solid Gym is able to raise four million dollars for to get started on their company because they'd already made some progress and today they've since raised 400 million dollars and they've scaled this up to having a full manufacturing plant let's talk about our next myth this idea that my startup needs to be impressive to raise money I've got to impress people with my startup but my startups startup is not very impressive so how can I ever do this well the reality is you don't need to impress investors you need to convince them and that's a slightly different thing see most startups seem terrible at first and in fact the best startups seem the most terrible at first so let's take Airbnb what was it it was a Marketplace for renting an air mattress on someone's floor terrible idea doordash food delivery for the suburbs where it takes longer to get everywhere and no one's ever started a delivery company before terrible idea open c a Marketplace for selling Collectibles that only exist on your computer and can only be paid for with magical internet money what but investors get this they know that your startup is going to sound unimpressive early on investors are pretty smart they get it and in fact they get bored when founders try to impress them okay really try to win them over and sell to them it bores them about 11 years ago and I did YC I had a chance to have a five minute meeting with Michael Moritz who at the time and it was a partner at Sequoia capital is legendary VC and I was so excited for this meeting I made a fancy deck I practiced all these lines I was going to use on him to impress him and conv and get him to invest in my startup and I sat down with him and I opened my laptop to get the slides out and he stopped me and just said I prefer to just talk about the business you're building and I was completely disarmed because I wasn't ready for that I was ready to impress him not to try to just talk about the business that I was building and we see this similar thinking with a lot of Founders at YC where they come to us they don't explicitly ask us this but they more or less say Brad what are the magic words I need to say to make investors want to invest in my startup and the reality is that it's not about magic words it's about making something people want right that YC Credo it's about making a product getting it into users hands and creating some value for them and then just explaining how there's a one percent chance even just a one percent chance that it can get huge and using plain simple language to do it that's how you convince investors okay if investors aren't investing it's not because you didn't say the magic words it's because your startup isn't good enough and you need to make your startup better and so have these conversate you make your startup better and you just explain it to people and talk about it like a human and do it over and over and over again because again startup fundraising is a grind here's an example of a company that did a great job convincing investors when they met with them this is retool and retool makes software for building internal tools it's a great company they raise their seed round you see the founder David and one of the CEO and co-founder by just meeting a bunch of investors in coffee shops in San Francisco I was lucky enough to meet with David and he had no DAC instead he just opened his laptop and showed me the software on his computer and he used that early kind of crude version of retool to make a crude but simple internal tool a little web app in minutes and then he talked about why his early customers really liked it and we're getting some value from it and just seeing this seeing him show me the product and talk about what his customers were making of it put in my head this idea that a lot of companies probably are going to need this I was convinced he didn't impress me he didn't try to wow me he just showed me and talked in a reasonable way about what he was doing and that convinced me I wrote a check and today that company is at a four billion dollar valuation wasn't about doing a fancy pitch but it wasn't about magic words it was just about making something and then talking about it with me the next myth I want to talk about is that raising money is complicated slow and expensive if you read a lot about fundraising in the Press you might think that it involves raising giant rounds from big name VCS why is that well let's take a look at yesterday's TechCrunch headlines about fundraising we've got a story about Shopify Mark Vision locket Sprague what do we see folks what's the common uh denominator here gigantic numbers and so you're reading this at home and you're just trying to think how can I raise twenty five thousand dollars to quit my job or spend more time on this or get a Hosting account for the website that I want to build you're not thinking about a hundred million dollars gosh maybe this isn't for you well the reality is is that all the rounds you read about in the news are series A's and growth rounds you don't read much about the actual you don't read anything about the actual first rounds of funding that",

                "text": "okay it's really boring we already established that there's no glamor in the actual early fundraising that startups do so it never makes the press these typical A and B rounds are huge right you raise 10 to 50 million dollars they take months to close and you pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to lawyers and legal fees to get these rounds done the good news is like I said that's not what a lot of these rounds look like your typical seed round is actually much smaller 500 000 maybe a couple million dollars you can close it in weeks if not days and there's no legal fees and this is the same for if you're trying to raise a precede or just trying to raise fifty thousand dollars from friends and family you can do that quickly and there's no need to get lawyers involved why is that well in 2013 YC created a new standard fundraising document called the safe the simple agreement for Equity so initially this was made by YC to be the new standard document that all YC companies would use and it turned out for fundraising and it turned out to be so great that now every startup uses this to raise their money the safes are awesome first off it's easy to understand it's only five pages long uh it's really fast to close an investment using a safe there's only a couple terms to discuss the amount of the investment the valuation cap of the investment and then the discount and guess what nobody does discounts so there's only two terms that you really need to discuss when closing a safe and finally they're cheap you don't need lawyers to send them also the safe is just on the YC website if you Google why combinator safe you can find the document download it to your computer and use it this afternoon to close an investment in your startup how cool is that safes are so simple that there's even a website called clerky it's a YC company from my batch summer 11 that lets you send and sign them in just a few clicks safes give Founders fundraising superpowers and you don't have to wait months for investors to get organized and for lawyers to review stuff founders today just take all the meetings they sign a bunch of safe and they raise Millions for their startup in just a few clicks and this quick and cheap fundraising gives them more leverage than ever when they're talking to investors here's an example you could build your company like Azure bio so this is a biotech startup from the summer 19 match that's developing cancer therapies again Capital intensive business and the typical first rounds of funding are tens of millions of dollars for companies like this and so Founders go they make a pitch deck and they've got to go get this money before they can start working on the on the startup the founders of Astra came into YC with just the idea and they were able to raise the first round of funding using safes quickly from Angels this is pretty novel for a biotech company and using that first million or so that they raised they could accelerate their progress they could make more progress in the lab and when they were ready to start talking to larger investors in the Pharma space about a proper round they've made a lot more progress and they had more leverage in talking to those investors they've since raised over 150 million dollars but that first million that they raised in safes totally changed the power dynamics for them when talking to investors the safety change the game for them related myth is this idea and I hear this a lot hey if I raise money I'm going to lose control of my company well the reality is that seed rounds today give Founders more control than ever okay Founders have had more can have more control over their companies today than ever in the history of startups and why is this it's because when you raise the safes you don't give up any board seats all right there's there's no board seat nonsense in safes after you close the investment it's still just you and your co-founders calling the shots there's no shareholders after you close money with safes the investors on safes gets shares in the next round okay so no Shares are actually changing hands and there's no information rights granted in safes so there's nobody like requesting to look into your books looking over your shoulder you get to choose how and when to update your investors when you raise money with safes so again Founders raising millions of dollars they're only selling 10 to 20 percent of their company and they're keeping total control of the companies and when you do that you can build the company the way you want and Answer to No One except your customers well pretty important but instead of answering new investors you answer to your customers when you raise seed rounds today here's a great example you could build your startup by zapier they describe themselves as three dudes from Missouri and zapier is software that help you set up Integrations if you've got one app that you use in another app and you want them to talk to each other you can use zapier to set that up it's awesome they did the YC summer 12 batch and they applied with an early version of their software they had a few customers and they raised over a million dollars from angels and small funds at demo day and because they did that because they raised on safes and they just raised a bunch of checks they were able to run their company the way they wanted and for them 10 years ago",

                "text": "ago a decade before it was cool for startups to do that it was pretty weird at the time and they ran their company the way they wanted to they spent the next decade just delighting thousands and thousands of customers and they also made the decision to never raise money again they never needed to so folks thinking gosh if I raise money I'm always going to be indebted to investors yada yada no maybe later if you raise these crazy priced rounds but for the early money that you raised on safes you have total control and you can be like the zap your Founders and never raise money again and today that's 100 million dollar Revenue business and they only raised money that one time now what about bootstrapping you might be thinking I should bootstrap my company well everybody bootstraps it first that's true but I want to tell you that bootstrapping your company forever sucks and here's why so first off when you bootstrap forever and what I mean by bootstrapping I mean um funding the company out of the revenue that you make from customers it's scary all right you're always about to shut down you're always about to run out of money it's miserable because you don't have any money to pay yourselves a decent salary to live on it's distracting you have to go into Consulting in order to make the money you need to keep working on your products sometimes you have all these detours when you're bootstrapping and then finally the odds just aren't great there are very few examples of 100 gigantic bootstrapped companies and I think if it was the way to go there'd be a lot more of those I actually want to propose the definition of bootstrapping so bootstrapping is taking the pain of fundraising and stretching it out across the entire life of your company why would you want to do that I propose to you that you should rip off the Band-Aid and take the pain up front and raise money for your company and then you never have to raise money again if you don't want to you can be like the zap your Founders and besides at the end of the day who's more in control of their startup in the end is it the bootstrapped founder who's always worried about running out of money or the founders that raise enough money to get the company going after they've built a product and gotten some users and they can just make their customers happy and they never have to raise again the next myth I want to talk about is this idea that I need a fancy Network to raise money the reality is that if you are making something people want investors don't care about where you went to school where you worked who you're friends with how old you are even investors are human and sure they notice pedigree but guess what folks investors are coin operated lizard people and they care a lot more about making money you can build your company like Podium Podium is a company that started off making customer review management software for tire shops all right if you're a tire shop and you're worried about what people are saying about you on Yelp you might use Podium to keep track of that the co-founders were two guys from Utah they had no Silicon Valley Network however they were really good at sales and they came into YC they were already making money and by the end of the batch they were making tens of thousands of dollars a month I actually randomly bumped into them at an alumni event during their batch and I was stunned that there was a company selling software to tire shops in y combinator and even more stunned when I found out how much money they were making investors noticed that too that they'd made something people want and they were able to raise and now today that company makes a hundred million dollars a year and has raised more than 200 million dollars these folks had no network these are not fancy Founders they just made something people want slight tangent while we're on this topic you'll probably run into people if you're thinking about fundraising who are going to offer to raise money for you I have the network I know investors let me go in there and Pitch your company it is not a good idea it's always best for the founders to talk to investors themselves it's an important relationship and you want to own it so if someone makes you that offer you should get them to make an introduction instead and then you can go take the meeting all right the last myth I'm going to talk about today is the myth that if investors reject my startup that means it's a bad startup the reality is that no matter how great your product is how much traction you have investors are going to reject you and that's okay in fact it puts you in great company right here's a great example Envision so Envision is a medical device startup for cancer detection and it was started by serbisarna who's a YC group partner today when Serbia started building Envision she had a devil of a Time raising her first check she was rejected more than 50 times by investors to just get the first money for the company and the way that she was able to convince someone to write that first check and to help her get this company started was she she told them she was going to bet on herself and take no salary for the first two years if the investor was willing to bet on them and that was for a 25 000 check her first round of funding for the company was only five hundred thousand dollars but she got it done and she got even though she got rejected over and over again and since then the company was acquired for 275 million dollars so here's this awesome medical device company that sold for",

                "text": "- The following is a\nconversation with Sam Harris, his second time on the podcast. As I said two years ago, when I first met and spoke with Sam, he's one of the most influential, pioneering thinkers of our time. As the host of the \"Making Sense Podcast,\" creator of the Waking Up App, and the author of many\nseminal books on human nature and the human mind, including \"The End of Faith,\" \"The Moral Landscape,\" \"Lying,\" \"Free Will,\" and \"Waking Up.\" In this conversation, besides our mutual fascination\nwith AGI and free will, we do also go deep into\ncontroversial challenging topics of Donald Trump, Hunter Biden, January 6th,\nvaccines, lab leak, Kanye West, and several key figures at the\ncenter of public discourse, including Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, both of whom have been friends of Sam and have become friends of mine. Somehow in an amazing life trajectory, that I do not deserve in any way, and in fact, believe is probably a figment of my imagination. And if it's all right, please allow me to say a few words about this personal\naspect of the conversation of discussing Joe, Elon and others. What's been weighing heavy on my heart since the beginning of the\npandemic now three years ago is that many people I look to for wisdom in public discourse stopped\ntalking to each other as often with respect, humility, and love, when the world needed those\nkinds of conversations the most. My hope is that they start talking again. They start being friends again. They start noticing the\nhumanity that connects them, that is much deeper than the\ndisagreements that divide them. So lemme take this moment to say, with humility and honesty, why I look up to and I'm\ninspired by Joe, Elon and Sam. I think Joe Rogan is\nimportant to the world as a voice of compassion and curiosity and open-mindedness to ideas,\nboth radical and mainstream, sometimes with humor,\nsometimes with brutal honesty, always pushing for more\nkindness in the world. I think Elon Musk is\nimportant to the world as an engineer, leader, entrepreneur, and human being who takes\non the hardest problems that face humanity and refuses to accept the constraints of conventional thinking that made the solutions to\nthese problems seem impossible. I think Sam Harris is\nimportant to the world as a fearless voice who\nfights for the pursuit of truth against growing\nforces of echo chambers and audience capture, taking unpopular perspectives\nand defending them with rigor and resilience. I both celebrate and\ncriticize all three privately, and they criticize me,\nusually more effectively, from which I always learn a\nlot and always appreciate. Most importantly, there is respect and love for each other as human beings, the very thing that I think\nthe world needs most now in a time of division and chaos. I will continue to try to mend divisions, to try to understand, not deride, to turn the other cheek if\nneeded, to return hate with love. Sometimes people criticize\nme for being naive, cheesy, simplistic, all of that. I know, I agree, but I really am speaking from\nthe heart, and I'm trying. This world is too fucking\nbeautiful not to try, in whatever way I know how. I love you all. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sam Harris. What is more effective at\nmaking a net positive impact on the world, empathy or reason? - It depends on what you mean by empathy. There are two, at least\ntwo kinds of empathy. There's the cognitive form, which is, you know, I would argue even a species of reason. It's just understanding\nanother person's point of view. You know, you understand\nwhy they're suffering or why they're happy or what, you know, just you have a theory of\nmind about another human being that is accurate. And so you can navigate in relationship to them more effectively. And then there's another layer entirely, not incompatible with\nthat, but just distinct, which is what people\noften mean by empathy, which is more a kind of\nemotional contagion, right? Like you feel depressed and I begin to feel\ndepressed along with you, because, you know, it's\njust, it's contagious, right? You know, we're so close and I'm so concerned about you, and your problems become my\nproblems, and it bleeds through. Right now, I think both\nof those capacities are very important but",

                "text": "and this is not really my thesis, this is something I have\nmore or less learned from Paul Bloom, the psychologist who wrote a book on this topic titled \"Against Empathy.\" The emotional social contagion piece is a bad guide rather often\nfor ethical behavior and ethical intuitions. - [Lex] Oh, boy. - And so I'll give you the\nclear example of this, which is, we find stories with a single identifiable protagonist who we can effortlessly empathize with far more compelling than data, right? So if I tell you, you know, this is the classic\ncase of the little girl who falls down a well, right? You know, this is somebody's daughter. You see the parents\ndistraught on television, you hear her cries from\nthe bottom of the well, the whole country stops. I mean, there was an\nexample of this, you know, 20, 25 years ago, I think, where it was just wall to wall on CNN. This is just the perfect use of CNN. It was, you know, 72\nhours or whatever it was, of continuous coverage of just extracting this girl from a well. So we effortlessly pay attention to that. We care about it, we will donate money toward it. I mean, it's just, it marshals 100% of our\ncompassion and altruistic impulse. Whereas if you hear that\nthere's a genocide raging in some country you've never been to and never intended to go to, and the numbers don't make a dent, and we find the story boring, right? And we'll change the channel in the face of a genocide, right? It doesn't matter. And it literally, perversely, it could be 500,000 little\ngirls have fallen down wells in that country and we\nstill don't care, right? So it's, you know, many of us have come to\nbelieve that this is a bug rather than a feature\nof our moral psychology. And so the empathy plays\nan unhelpful role there. So ultimately, I think, when we're making big decisions about what we should do and how\nto mitigate human suffering and what's worth valuing and how we should protect those values, I think reason is the better tool. But it's not that I would wanna dispense with any part of empathy either. - Well, there's a lot of\ndangers to go on there, but briefly to mention, you've recently talked\nabout effective altruism on your podcast. I think you mentioned some\ninteresting statement. I'm going to horribly misquote you, but that you'd rather live in a world, like it doesn't really make sense, but you'd rather live in a world where you'd care about maybe\nyour daughter and son more than a hundred people that\nlive across the world, something like this. - Yeah.\n- Like where the calculus is not always perfect, but somehow it makes\nsense to live in a world where it's irrational in this way, and yet empathetic in the\nway you've been discussing. - Right, I'm not sure what\nthe right answer is there, or even whether there is one right answer. There could be multiple, you know, peaks on this part of the moral landscape. But so the opposition is between an ethic that's articulated by, you know, someone like\nthe Dalai Lama, right? Or really any exponent of, you know, classic Buddhism would say that sort of the ultimate enlightened ethic is true dispassion with respect to friends and strangers, right? So that you would, you know, the mind of the Buddha would\nbe truly dispassionate. You would love and care\nabout all people equally. And by that light, it seems some kind of ethical failing, or at least, you know, failure of, to fully actualize compassion\nin the limit, or, you know, enlightened wisdom in\nthe limit, to care more, and much more about\nyour kids than the kids of other people or and to prioritize your energy in that way, right? So you spend all this time\ntrying to figure out how to keep your kids healthy and happy and you'll attend to\ntheir minutest concerns, and however superficial. And again, there's a genocide\nraging in Sudan or wherever, and it takes up less than\n1% of your bandwidth. I'm not sure it would be\na better world if everyone was running the Dalai Lama program there. I think some prioritization of one's nearest and dearest ethically might be optimal, because we'll all be doing that, and we'll all be doing that in a circumstance where we have certain norms and laws and other structures that force us to be dispassionate where that matters, right? So like when I go to, when my daughter gets sick, and I have to take her to a hospital, you know, I really want her\nto get attention, right?",

                "text": "than I'm worried about\neveryone else in the lobby. But the truth is, I actually don't want a\ntotally corrupt hospital. I don't want a hospital that\ntreats my daughter better than anyone else in the lobby\nbecause she's my daughter, and I've, you know, bribed the\nguy at the door or whatever, you know, or the guy's\na fan of my podcast, or whatever the thing is. You don't want starkly,\ncorrupt, unfair situations. And when you sorta get pressed down the hierarchy of Maslow's needs, you know, individually and societally, a bunch of those variables change and they change for the\nworst, understandably. But yeah, when everyone's corrupt, and you're in a state of collective emergency, you know, you've got a lifeboat problem, you're scrambling to get\ninto the lifeboat, yeah, then fairness and norms and, you know, the other vestiges of civilization begin to get stripped off. We can't reason from those\nemergencies to normal life. I mean, in normal life, we\nwant justice, we want fairness, we're all better off for it, even when the spotlight of our concern is focused on the people we know, the people who are our friends,\nthe people who are family, people we have good reason to care about, we still, by default want\na system that protects the interests of strangers too. And we know that, generally speaking, interested in game theoretical terms, we're all gonna tend to be better off in a fair system than a corrupt one. - One of the failure modes of empathy is our susceptibility to anecdotal data. Just a good story will get\nus to not think clearly. But what about empathy in the context of just discussing\nideas with other people, and then there's a large number of people, like in this country, you know, red and blue, half the population\nbelieves certain things on immigration or on (chuckles) the response to the pandemic or any kind of controversial issue, even if the election was fairly executed. Having an empathy for their worldview, trying to understand\nwhere they're coming from, not just in the explicit\nstatement of their idea, but the entirety of like the roots from which their idea stems, that kind of empathy, while\nyou're discussing ideas, what is, in your pursuit of truth, having empathy for the perspective of a large number of other people versus raw mathematical reason. - I think it's important, but it only takes you so far, right? It doesn't get you to truth, right? Truth is not a, it's not decided by, you know, democratic principles and certain people believe things\nfor understandable reasons, but those reasons are\nnonetheless bad reasons, right? They don't scale, they don't generalize. They're not reasons anyone\nshould adopt for themselves or respect, you know, epistemologically. And yet their circumstance\nis understandable and it's something you\ncan care about, right? And so, yeah, like, I mean, just take, I think there's many examples of this you might be\nthinking of, but, I mean, one that comes to mind is\nI've been super critical of Trump, obviously, and I've been super\ncritical of certain people for endorsing him or not criticizing him when\nhe really made it, you know, patently obvious who he was. You know, if there had\nbeen any doubt initially, there was no doubt when we\nhave a sitting president who's not agreeing to a peaceful transfer of power, right? So I'm critical of all of that and yet the fact that many millions of Americans didn't see what was wrong with\nTrump or bought into the, didn't see through his con, right? I mean, they bought into\nthe idea that he was a brilliant businessman who might just be able to change things, because he's so unconventional\nand so, you know, his heart is in the right place, you know, he's really a man of the\npeople, even though he's, you know, gold-plated\neverything in his life. They bought the myth somehow of, you know, largely because they had\nseen him on television for almost a decade and a half, pretending to be this genius businessman who could get things done. It's understandable to me that\nmany very frustrated people who have not had their\nhopes and dreams actualized, who have been the victims of globalism and many other, you know, current trends.",

But then you can recognize that people have very different life experiences and, yeah, I mean, I think\nempathy and, you know, probably the better word\nfor what I would hope to embody there is compassion, right? Like, really, you know, to really wish people well, you know, and to really wish, you know, strangers well effortlessly,\nwish them well, I mean, to realize that there is\nno opposition between, at bottom, there's no real opposition between selfishness and selflessness, because why selfishness really takes into account other people's happiness. I mean, you know, do you wanna live in a society\nwhere you have everything, but most other people have nothing? Or do you wanna live in a society where you're surrounded\nby happy, creative, self-actualized people\nwho are having their hopes and dreams realized? I think it's obvious that the second society is much better, however much you can guard your good luck. - But what about having\nempathy for certain principles that people believe, for example, the pushback, the other\nperspective on this, 'cause you said, \"Bought the myth of Trump\nas the great businessman.\" There could be a lot of people\nthat are supporters as Trump who could say that Sam\nHarris bought the myth that we have this government of the people by the people that actually represents the people, as opposed to a bunch of\nelites who are running a giant bureaucracy that is corrupt, that is feeding themselves and they're actually not\nrepresenting the people. And then here's this chaos agent, Trump, who speaks off the top of his head, yeah, he's flawed in all this number of ways. He's a more comedian than he is a presidential type of figure. And he's actually\ncreating the kind of chaos that's going to shake up this bureaucracy, shake up the elites that\nare so uncomfortable, 'cause they don't want\nthe world to know about the game they got running\non everybody else. So that's-\n- Yeah. - That's the kind of perspective that they would take and say, yeah, yeah, there's these\nflaws that Trump has, but this is necessary. - I agree with the first part, so I haven't bought the myth that it's, you know, a truly representative democracy in the way that you might idealize. And, you know, on some level, I mean, this is a different conversation, but on some level, I'm not even sure how much\nI think it should be, right? Like I'm not sure we want, in the end, everyone's opinion given equal weight about, you know, just what we\nshould do about anything. And I include myself in that. I mean, there are many topics around, which I don't deserve to have a strong opinion because I don't know what I'm talking about, right? Or what I would be talking\nabout if I had a strong opinion. And I think we'll probably get to that, to some of those topics, because I've declined to\nhave certain conversations on my podcast just because\nI think I'm the wrong person to have that conversation, right? And I think it's important\nto see those bright lines in one's life and in the moment\npolitically and ethically. So, yeah, I think, so leave aside the viability of democracy, but I'm under no illusions that all of our institutions are, you know, worth preserving precisely\nas they have been up until the moment this\ngreat orange wrecking ball came swinging through our lives. But I just, it was a very bad bet to elect someone who is grossly incompetent and worse than incompetent, genuinely malevolent in\nhis selfishness, right? And this is something we know\nbased on literally decades of him being in the public eye, right? He's not a public servant in\nany normal sense of that term. And he couldn't possibly give an honest or sane answer to the\nquestion you asked me about empathy and reason\nand like how should we, you know, what should guide us?",

And this is, I can feel compassion\nfor him as a human being, because I think having those\nthings is incredibly important and genuinely loving other\npeople is incredibly important. And knowing what all that's about is, that's really the good stuff in life. And I think he's missing a lot of that. But I think we don't wanna promote people to the highest positions\nof power in our society who are far outliers in pathological terms, right? We want them to be far outliers in, if in the best case, in wisdom and compassion, and some of the things you've, some of the topics you've brought up. I mean, we want someone\nto be deeply informed. We want someone to be unusually curious, unusually\nalert to how they may be wrong or getting things wrong, consequentially. He's none of those things. And if in so far as we're\ngonna get normal mediocrities in that role, which I think, you know, is often the best we could expect, let's get normal\nmediocrities in that role. Not, you know, once in a\ngeneration narcissists and frauds, I mean, it is like the, I mean, just take honesty\nas a single variable, right? I think you want, yes, it's possible that most politicians lie, at least some of the time. I don't think that's a good thing. I think people should be,\nyou know, generally honest, even to a fault. Yes, there are certain\ncircumstances where lying, I think is necessary. It's kind of on a continuum\nof self-defense and violence. So it's like, if you're gonna, you know, if the Nazis come to your door and ask you if you've got Anne Frank in the attic, I think it's okay to lie to them. But, you know, Trump, arguably, there's never been a person that anyone could name in human history who's lied\nwith that kind of velocity. I mean, it's just, he was just a blizzard of lies, great and small, you know, to pointless, and effective, but it is just, it says something fairly alarming about our society that a person of that\ncharacter got promoted. And so, yes, I have compassion and concern for half of the society\nwho didn't see it that way. And that's gonna sound elitist and smug or something for anyone who's on that side listening\nto me, but it's genuine. I mean, I understand\nthat like I barely have, I'm like one of the luckiest\npeople in the world, and I barely have the\nbandwidth to pay attention to half the things I\nshould pay attention to in order to have an opinion about half the things we're\ngonna talk about, right? So how much less bandwidth is somebody who's working two jobs or, you know, a single mom who's, you know, raising, you know,\nmultiple kids, you know, even a single kid. It's just, it's unimaginable\nto me that people have the bandwidth to really track this stuff. And so then they jump on social media and they get inundated by misinformation and they see what their\nfavorite influencer just said. And now they're worried\nabout vaccines and it's just, we're living in an environment where the information space\nhas become so corrupted and we've built machines\nto further corrupt it, you know what I mean? We've built a business\nmodel for the internet that has further corrupts it. So it is just, it's chaos in informational terms. And I don't fault people for being confused and impatient and at their wit's end. And, yes, Trump was an enormous fuck you to the establishment. And that was understandable\nfor many reasons. - To me, Sam Harris, the great Sam Harris is\nsomebody I've looked up to for a long time as a beacon of voice of reason. And there's this meme on the internet, and I would love you to steelman the case for it and against that Trump\nbroke Sam Harris's brain, that there is something is disproportional to the\nactual impact that Trump had on our society. He had an impact on the ability of balanced, calm, rational minds to\nsee the world clearly, to think clearly. You being one of the beacons of that. Is there a degree to\nwhich he broke your brain? - Well...\n- Otherwise known as Trump derangement syndrome. - [Sam] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - (chuckling) Medical petition. - Yeah, I mean, I think\nTrump derangement syndrome",

But in truth, the true Trump derangement\nsyndrome was not to have seen how dangerous and divisive it it would be to promote someone like Trump\nto that position of power and in the final moment, not to see how untenable it was to still\nsupport someone who, you know, a sitting president\nwho was not committing to a peaceful transfer of power. I mean, that was, if that wasn't a bright line for you, you have been deranged by something, because that was, you know, that was one minute to\nmidnight for our democracy, as far as I'm concerned. And I think it really was but for the integrity of a few people that we didn't suffer some real constitutional crisis and real emergency, you know, after January 6th. I mean, if Mike Pence had caved in and decided to not certify\nthe election, right? Literally you can count on two hands the number of people\nwho held things together at that moment. And it wasn't for a want\nof trying on Trump's part that we didn't succumb to some, you know, real, truly uncharted catastrophe with our democracy. So the fact that that didn't happen is not a sign that those of us who were worried that\nit was so close to happening were exaggerating the problem. I mean, it's like, you know, you almost got run over\nby a car, but you didn't. And so, you know, the fact that you're\nadrenalized and you're thinking, you know, but boy, that was dangerous. I probably shouldn't, you know, wander in the middle of the\nstreet with my eyes closed. You weren't wrong to feel that you really had a problem, right? And came very close to\nsomething truly terrible. So I think that's where we were, and I think we shouldn't\ndo that again, right? So the fact that he's still, he's coming back around as\npotentially a viable candidate, you know, I'm not spending\nmuch time thinking about it, frankly, because it's, you know, I'm waiting for the moment where it requires some thought. I mean, it did, it took up, I mean, I don't know how\nmany podcasts I devoted to the topic. It wasn't that, I mean, it\nwasn't that many in the end, you know, against the number of podcasts I devoted to other topics. But there are people who look at Trump and just find him funny, entertaining, not especially threatening, like not a, you know, it's just good fun to\nsee somebody who's like, who's just not taking anything seriously. And is just putting, you know, a stick in the wheel of business as usual again\nand again and again and again. And they don't really see\nanything much at stake, right? It doesn't really matter\nif we don't support NATO, it doesn't really matter if\nhe says he trusts Putin more than our intelligence services. I mean, none of this is, it doesn't matter if he's\non the one hand saying that he loves the leader of North Korea and on the other threatens to, you know, bomb them back to the stone age, right, on Twitter. It all can be taken in the spirit of kinda reality television. It's like, this is just, this is the part of the\nmovie that's just fun to watch, right? And I understand that. I can even inhabit that space for a few minutes at a time but there's the deeper concern\nthat we're in the process of entertaining ourselves to death, right? That we're just not\ntaking things seriously. And this is a problem I've\nhad with several other people we might name who just appear to me to\nbe goofing around at scale. And they lack a kind of moral seriousness. I mean, they're touching big problems where lives hang in the balance, but they're just fucking around. And I think they're\nreally important problems that we have to get our\nheads straight around. And we need, you know, it's not to say that institutions don't become corrupt. I think they do. And I think, and I'm quite worried that, you know, both about the loss of trust in our institutions and the fact that trust has eroded\nfor a good reason, right? That they had become less trustworthy. You know, they've become\ninfected by, you know, political ideologies that\nare not truth-tracking. I mean, I worry about all of that, but I just think we need institutions. We need to rebuild them. We need experts who are real experts. We need to value expertise over, you know, amateurish speculation\nand conspiracy thinking, and just, you know, and bullshit. - The kind of amateur\nspeculation we're doing on this very podcast?

Like, I mean, you can invite someone onto your podcast who's an expert about something that you're not an expert about and then you, you in the process of getting\nmore informed yourself, your audience is getting more informed. So you're asking smart questions. And you might be pushing\nback at the margins, but you know that when push\ncomes to shove on that topic, you really don't have a basis to have a strong opinion. And if you were gonna form a strong opinion that was this counter to the expert you have in front of you, it's gonna be by deference\nto some other expert who you've brought in or\nwho you've heard about, or whose work you've read or whatever. But there's a paradox to how we value authority in science that most people don't understand. And I think we should, at\nsome point unravel that, because it's the basis for\na lot of public confusion. And frankly it's the basis\nfor a lot of, you know, criticism I've received on\nthese topics where it's, you know, people think\nthat I'm a, you know, I'm against free speech, or\nI'm an establishment shill, or it's like I just think\nI'm a credentialist. I just think people with PhDs from Ivy League Universities should, you know, run everything. It's not true, but there's a ton of, there's a lot to cut through\nto get to daylight there, because people are very confused about how we value authority in the service of rationality generally. - You've talked about it,\nbut it's just interesting, the intensity of feeling you have. You've had this famous\nphrase about Hunter Biden and children in the basement. Can you just revisit this case? So let me, let me give another perspective on the situation of January\n6th and Trump in general. It's possible that January\n6th and things of that nature revealed that our democracy\nis actually pretty fragile and that Trump is not a malevolent, an ultra competent malevolent figure, but is simply a jokester. And he just, by creating the chaos, revealed that it's all pretty fragile, because you're a student of history, and there's a lot of people\nlike Vladimir Lenin, Hitler, who are exceptionally\ncompetent at controlling power, at being executives,\nand taking that power, controlling the generals, controlling all the figures involved, and certainly not tweeting, but working in the shadows,\nbehind the scenes to gain power. And they did so extremely competently, and that is how they\nwere able to gain power. The pushback with Trump is\nhe was doing none of that. He was creating what he's very good at, creating drama, sometimes for humor's sake, sometimes for drama's sake, and simply revealed that\nour democracy is fragile. And so he's not this once in\na generation horrible figure. - Once in a generation narcissist. No, I don't think he's a truly scary, sinister, you know, Putin-like,\nor, you know, Hitler, much less Hitler-like figure, not at all. I mean, he's not ideological. He doesn't care about\nanything beyond himself. So it's not, no, no, he's much less scary than any really scary, you\nknow, totalitarian, right? I mean, and he's... - He's more \"Brave New World\" than 1984? - This is what, you know, Eric Weinstein never\nstops badgering me about, but, you know, he's still wrong, Eric. You know, I can, you know, my analogy\nfor Trump was that he's an evil Chauncey Gardiner. I don't know if you remember the book or the film \"Being\nThere\" with Peter Sellers, but, you know, Peter\nSellers is this gardener who really doesn't know anything, but he gets recognized as this wise man and he gets promoted to\nimmense power in Washington, because he's speaking in these kinda, in a semblance of wisdom. He's got these very simple aphorisms, what seemed to be aphorisms. He's just talking, all he\ncares about is gardening. He's just talking about\nhis garden all the time. But, you know, he'll\nsay something, but yeah. you know, in the spring, you know, the new shoots will bloom. And people read into that\nsome kind of genius, you know, insight politically,\nand so he gets promoted. And so that's the joke of the film. For me, Trump has always been someone like an evil Chauncey Gardiner. It's not to say he's totally, yes, he has a certain kind of genius. He's got a genius for creating a spectacle around himself, right? He's got a genius for getting",

It's like his pure, the pure pornography of attention, right? And he just wants more of it. I think the truly depressing and genuinely scary thing was that we have a country that, at least half of the country, given how broken our society is in many ways, we have a country that didn't\nsee anything wrong with that. Bringing someone who\nobviously doesn't know what he should know to be president and who's obviously not\na good person, right? Who obviously doesn't care about people, can't even pretend to care\nabout people, really, right, in a credible way. And so, I mean, if there's\na silver lining to this, it's along the lines you just sketched, it shows us how vulnerable our system is to a truly brilliant and\nsinister figure, right? I mean, like, I think we are, we really dodged a bullet, yes. Someone far more competent and conniving and ideological could have exploited our system\nin a way that Trump didn't. And that's, yeah, so if we plug those holes eventually, that would be a good thing and he would've done a good\nthing for our society, right? I mean, one of the things we realized, and I think nobody knew, I mean, I certainly didn't know it and I didn't hear anyone talk about it, is how much our system relies\non norms rather than laws. - Yeah, civility almost.\n- Right. Yeah. It's just like it's quite possible that he\nnever did anything illegal. You know, truly illegal. I mean, I think he probably\ndid a few illegal things, but like illegal such that\nhe really should be thrown in jail for it, you know? At least that remains to be seen. So all of the chaos, all of the, you know, all of the diminishment of\nour stature in the world, all of the, just the opportunity costs of spending years focused on nonsense, all that was just norm violations. All of that was just, that was just all a matter of not saying the thing you should say, but that doesn't mean\nthey're insignificant, right? It's not that, it's like, it's not illegal for a\nsitting president to say, no, I'm not gonna commit to a\npeaceful transfer of power, right? We'll wait and see whether I win. If I win, the election was valid. If I lose, it was fraudulent, right? - But aren't those humorous perturbations to our system of civility\nsuch that we know what the limits are, and now we start to think that and have these kinds of discussions? - But that wasn't a humorous perturbation, because he did everything he could, granted he wasn't very competent, but he did everything he could to try to steal the election. I mean, the irony is he claimed to have an election stolen from him all the while doing everything\nhe could to steal it, declaring it fraudulent in advance, trying to get the votes to not be counted as the evening wore on, knowing that they were gonna be disproportionately democrat votes, because of the, you know, because of the position he\ntook on mail-in ballots. I mean, all of it was fairly calculated. The whole circus of, you know, the clown car\nthat crashed into, you know, the Four Seasons landscaping, right? And you got Rudy Giuliani\nwith his hair dye and you got Sidney Powell and all these grossly\nincompetent people lying as freely as they could breathe\nabout election fraud, right? And all of these things\nwere getting thrown out by, you know, Republican, largely Republican election\nofficials and Republican judges. It wasn't for want of trying that he didn't maintain\nhis power in this country. He really tried to steal the presidency. He just was not competent, and the people around\nhim weren't competent. So that's a good thing, and it's worth not\nletting that happen again. - But he was incompetent, so he didn't do everything he could. - Well, no, he did everything he could. He didn't do everything\nthat could have been done by someone more competent. - Right, but the tools\nyou have as a president, you could do a lot of things. You can declare emergencies, especially during COVID. You could postpone the election. You can create military\nconflict that, you know, any kind of reason to\npostpone the election. There's a lot of ways.\n- Well, but he tried to do things and he would have to have done those things\nthrough other people.",

So there's a cynicism to all of that that I think we should\nbe deeply critical of. - What I'm trying to understand is not, and analyze, is not the behavior of this particular human being, but the effect it had, in part, on the division between people. And to me, the degree, the meme of Sam Harris's\nbrain being broken by Trump represents, you're like the person I would look to to bridge the division. - Well, I don't think there\nis something profitably to be said to someone who's truly captivated by the personality cult of Trumpism, right? Like there's nothing\nthat I'm gonna say to, there's no conversation I'm\ngonna have with Candace Owens, say, about Trump that's gonna converge on something reasonable, right?\n- You don't think so? - No, I mean, I haven't\ntried with Candace, but I've tried with, you know, many people who are in\nthat particular orbit. I mean, I've had\nconversations with people who won't admit that there's anything wrong with Trump, anything. - So I'd like to push for\nthe empathy versus reason, 'cause when you operate in\nthe space of reason, yes. But I think there's a lot\nof power in you showing, in you, Sam Harris,\nshowing that you're willing to see the good qualities of Trump, publicly showing that. I think that's the way to win over Candace Owens.\n- Well, but he has so few of them. He has fewer good qualities than virtually anyone I can name, right? So he's funny. I'll grant you that, he's funny. He's a good entertainer. - There's others, look at just policies and actual impacts he had. - I've admitted that. No, no, so like, so\nI've admitted that many of his policies I agree with. Many, many of his policy, I mean, so probably more often than not, at least on balance, I agreed with his policy that, you know, we should take China seriously\nas an adversary, right? And I think, I mean, again, there's a lot of fine\nprint to a lot of this, 'cause the way he talks about these things and many of his motives that are obvious are things that I don't support, but I'm gonna take immigration. I think there's, it's obvious that we should have control of our borders, right? Like I don't see the argument\nfor not having control of our borders. We should let in who we wanna let in, and we should keep out\nwho we wanna keep out, and we should have a\nsane immigration policy. So I didn't necessarily\nthink it was a priority to build the wall, but I never criticized the\nimpulse to build the wall, because if, you know, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are coming across that border\nand we are not in a position to know who's coming, that seems untenable to me. And I can recognize that\nmany people in our society are, on balance, the\nvictims of immigration, and there is, in many cases a zero sum\ncontest between the interests of actual citizens and the\ninterests of immigrants, right? So I think we should have control of our borders, we should have a sane and\ncompassionate immigration policy, we should let in refugees, right? So, you know, Trump on\nrefugees was terrible but, no, like I would say 80% of\nthe policy concerns people",

                "text": "are concerns that I either share entirely or certainly sympathize with, right? So like that's not the issue. The issue is... - A threat to democracy in some fundamental way?\n- Well, the issue is largely what you said it was. It's not so much the person, it's the effect on\neverything he touches, right? He just, he has this superpower of deranging and destabilizing almost everything he touches and selling and compromising the\nintegrity of almost anyone who comes into his orbit. I mean, so you looked at these\npeople who served, you know, as chief of staff or, you know, in various cabinet positions, people who had real reputations, you know, for probity and levelheadedness, you know, whether you shared their politics or not. I mean, these were real people. These were not, you know, some of them were goofballs, but, you know, many people who just got totally trashed by proximity to him and then trashed by him when they finally parted company with him. Yeah, I mean, it's just\npeople bent over backwards to accommodate his norm violations. And it was bad for them and it was bad for our system. But none of that discounts\nthe fact that we have a system that really needs\na proper house cleaning. Yes, there are bad incentives and entrenched interests and I'm not a fan of the\nconcept of the deep state, 'cause it, you know, has\nbeen so propagandized. But yes, there's something\nlike that, you know, that is not flexible enough to respond intelligently to the needs of the moment, right? So there's a lot of\nrethinking of government and of institutions in general\nthat I think we should do, but we need smart, well-informed, well-intentioned people to do that job. And the well-intentioned part is hugely important, right? I mean, just give me someone who is not the most selfish person anyone has ever heard about in their lifetime, right? And what we got with\nTrump was that like the, literally the one most selfish person I think anyone could name. I mean, and again, there's so much known about\nthis man, that's the thing. It was like, it predates his presidency. We knew this guy 30 years ago. And this is what, to come back to those inflammatory comments\nabout Hunter Biden's laptop. The reason why I can say with\nconfidence that I don't care what was on his laptop is that there is, and that includes any\nevidence of corruption on the part of his father. Right now there's been\nprecious little of that that's actually emerged. So it's like there is no, as far as I can tell, there's not a big story\nassociated with that laptop as much as people bang\non about a few emails. But even if there were just\nobvious corruption, right? Like Joe Biden was at this\nmeeting and he took, you know, this amount of money from this shady guy for bad reasons, right? Given how visible the lives of these two men have been, right? I mean, given how much\nwe know about Joe Biden and how much we know about Donald Trump and how they have lived in public for almost as long as I've been alive, both of them, the scale of corruption can't possibly balance out between the two of them, right? If you show me that Joe\nBiden has this secret life where he's driving a Bugatti and he's living like Andrew Tate, right? And he's doing all these things\nI didn't know about, okay, then I'm gonna start getting\na sense that, all right, maybe this guy is way more\ncorrupt than I realize. Maybe there is some deal\nin Ukraine or with China that is just, like this\nguy's not who he seems, he's not the public servant\nhe's been pretending to be, he's been on the take\nfor decades and decades and he's just, he's as dirty as can be. He's all mobbed up and is a nightmare and he can't be trusted, right? That's possible if you\nshow me that his life is not at all what it seems. But on the assumption that I, having looked at this guy\nfor literally decades, right? And knowing that every journalist has looked at him for decades, just how many affairs is he having? Just how much, you know, how many drugs is he doing? How many houses does he have? You know, what are the obvious conflicts of interest, you know? You hold that against what\nwe know about Trump, right?",

                "text": "you can put on Trump's side that testify to his personal corruption, to testify to the fact that\nhe has no ethical compass, there's simply no comparison, right? So that's why I don't care\nabout what's on the laptop. Now if you tell me Trump\nis no longer running for president in 2024, and we can put Trumpism behind us, and now you're saying, listen, there's a lot of stuff on that laptop that makes Joe Biden look\nlike a total asshole. Okay, I'm all ears, right? I mean, it was a forced, in 2020, it was a forced choice between a sitting president who wouldn't commit to a\npeaceful transfer of power and a guy who's obviously\ntoo old to be president, who has a crack-addicted son, you know, who lost his laptop. And I just knew that\nI was gonna take Biden in spite of whatever litany of horrors was gonna come tumbling\nout of that laptop. - And that might involve sort of, so the actual quote is, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in the basement. There's dark humor to it, right? Which is, I think you speak to, \"I would not have cared. There's nothing, it's Hunter Biden. It's not Joe Biden. Whatever the scope of Joe\nBiden's corruption is, it is infant decimally compared to the corruption we know\nTrump was involved in. It's like a firefly to the sun\"\nis what you're speaking to. But lemme make the case\nthat you're really focused on the surface stuff. That it's possible to have corruption that masquerades in\nthe thing we mentioned, which is civility. You can spend hundreds\nof billions of dollars or trillions towards the war in the Middle East, for example. Something that you've changed your mind on in terms of the negative\nimpact it has on the world. And that, you know, the military industrial complex, everybody's very nice. Everybody's very civil, just very upfront. Here's how we're spending the money. Yeah, it sometimes somehow\ndisappears in different places, but that's the way, you\nknow, war is complicated. And everyone is very polite. There's no coke and strippers or whatever is on the laptop. It's very nice and polite. In the meanwhile, hundreds of thousands\nof civilians die, hate, just an incredible amount\nof hate is created, because people lose their family members, all that kind of stuff. But there's no strippers\nand coke on the laptop so. - But yeah, but it's not just superficial. It is when someone only wants wealth and power and fame, that is their objective function, right? They're like a robot that is calibrated just\nto those variables, right? And they don't care about the risks we run on any other front. They don't care about, I\nmean, environmental risk, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation risk, none of it, right? They're just tracking fame and money and whatever can personally redound to their self-interest,\nalong those lines. And they're not informed about the other risk we're running really. I mean, in Trump, you had a president who was\nrepeatedly asking his generals, why couldn't we use our nuclear weapons? Why can't we have more of them? Why do I have fewer nuclear\nweapons than JFK, right? As though that were a sign of anything other than progress, right? And this is the guy who's\ngot the button, right? I mean, somebody's following\nhim around with a bag waiting to take his order to launch, right? That is a, it's just it's a risk we should never run. One thing Trump has\ngoing for him, I think, is that he doesn't drink\nor do drugs, right? Although there's, you know, people allege that he\ndoes speed, but, you know, let's take him at his word. He's not deranging himself with pharmaceuticals at least. But, apart from Diet Coke. (Lex chuckles) But-\n- There's nothing wrong. Just for the record, let me push back on that, there's nothing wrong with Diet Coke.\n- Nothing wrong, yeah. - You can consume it at\nvery large amounts so- - [Sam] I occasionally have some myself. - There's no medical, there's\nno scientific evidence that I observed the\nnegatives of, you know, all those studies about\naspartame and all of that. There's, no, I don't know. (chuckles) - I hope you're right. - I hope so too. (chuckles) - Yeah, I mean, everything you said about the military industrial\ncomplex is true, right? And it's been, we've been worrying\nabout that on both sides of the aisle for a very long time. I mean, that's just, you know, that phrase came from Eisenhower. I mean, so much of what ails us is a story of bad incentives, right? And bad incentives are so powerful",

Like so it's like you want, at minimum, you want\nreasonably good people, at least non-pathological people in the system trying to navigate against the grain of bad incentives. And, better still, all of us can get together and try to diagnose those\nincentives and change them, right? And we will really succeed when we have a system of incentives where the good incentives are so strong that even bad people are effortlessly behaving as though they're good people, because they're so\nsuccessfully incentivized to behave that way, right? That's, you know, and so it's almost almost the inversion of our current situation. So yes, and you say I changed\nmy mind about the war. Mot quite, I mean, I was never a supporter of the war in Iraq. I was always worried that it was a distraction from the war in Afghanistan. I was a supporter of\nthe war in Afghanistan. And I will admit in hindsight,\nthat looks like, you know, at best, a highly ambiguous\nand painful exercise, you know, more likely a fool's errand, right? I was like, you know, it\ndid not turn out well. It wasn't for want of trying. You know, I have not done a deep dive on all of the failures there and maybe all of these failures\nare failures in principle. I mean, maybe that's not the kind of thing that can be done well by anybody, whatever our intentions. But yeah, the move to Iraq\nalways seemed questionable to me. And when we knew the problem, the immediate problem at that\nmoment, you know, Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan and, you know, and then bounced into Pakistan, anyway, you know, so, yes, but my sense of the\npossibility of nation-building, my sense of, you know, in so far as the neocon spirit of, of, you know,\nresponsibility and idealism that, you know, America was the kind of nation that should be functioning in this way as the world's cop. And we have to get in there and untangle some of these knots by force rather often, because, you know, if we don't do it over there, we're gonna have to do it\nover here kind of thing. Yeah, some of that has\ndefinitely changed for me in my thinking. I mean, there are obviously\ncultural reasons why it failed in Afghanistan, and then if you can't change the culture, you're not gonna force a change\nat gunpoint in the culture, or certainly it seems that\nthat's not gonna happen. And it took us, you know, over 20 years to\napparently to realize that. - That's one of the things\nyou realize with the wars, there's not going to be a strong signal that things are not working. You can just keep pouring\nmoney into a thing and military effort. - Well also there are\nsigns of it working too. You have all the stories\nof girls now going to school, right? You know, the girls are\ngetting battery acid thrown in their faces by religious maniacs. And then we come in\nthere and we stop that, and now girls are getting\neducated and there's, and that's all good and our\nintentions are good there. And, I mean, we're on the\nright side of history there. Girls should be going to school. You know, Malala Yousafzai\nshould have the Nobel Prize, and she shouldn't have\nbeen shot in the face by the Taliban, right? We know what the right answers are there. The question is, what do you do when there are enough, in this particular case, religious maniacs who are willing to die and let their children die in defense of crazy ideas and moral norms that belong in the seventh century. And it's a problem we couldn't solve, and we couldn't solve it even\nthough we spent, you know, trillions of dollars to solve it. - Just reminded me of the thing that you and Jack Dorsey jokingly had for a while, the discussion about banning\nDonald Trump from Twitter. But does any of it bother you now that Twitter files came out that, I mean, this has to do with sort\nof the Hunter laptop, Hunter Biden laptop story. Does it bother you that there could be a collection of people\nthat make decisions about who to ban or not and that that could be susceptible to bias and to ideological influence? - Well, I think it always will be or in the absence of perfect\nAI, it always will be. - And this becomes\nrelevant with AI as well? - [Same] Yeah. - Because there's some\ncensorship in AI happening. - Yeah.\n- And it's an interesting question there as well. - I don't think Twitter is important as people think it is, right?

It's like it is just, even the good parts of Twitter that I miss were bad in the aggregate, in the degree to which it\nwas fragmenting my attention, the degree to which my\nlife was getting doled out to me in periods between those moments where I checked Twitter, right? And had my attention diverted. And I was, you know, I was not a crazy Twitter addict. I mean, I was probably\na pretty normal user. I mean, I was not someone who\nwas tweeting multiple times a day or even every day, right? I mean, I probably, I think I probably averaged\nsomething like one tweet a day, I think I averaged, but in\nreality it was like, you know, there'd be like four tweets one day, and then I wouldn't tweet for, you know, the better part of a week. But I was looking a lot,\nbecause it was my newsfeed. I was just following, you\nknow, 200 very smart people, and I would just wanted to see what they were paying attention to and they would recommend articles and I would read those articles. And then when I would read an article that I thought I should\nsignal boost, I would tweet. And so all of that seemed good. And like that's all separable from all of the otiose\nbullshit that came back at me in response to this, largely in response to\nthis Hunter Biden thing. But even the good stuff has a downside. And it comes at just this point of your phone is this perpetual stimulus of which is intrinsically\nfragmenting of time and attention. And now my phone is much less\nof a presence in my life. And it's not that I don't\ncheck Slack or check email. I mean, you know, I use it to work but my sense of just what the world is and my sense of my place in the world, the sense of where I exist as a person has changed a lot by\ndeleting my Twitter account. I mean, I had, and it's just, it's, and the things that I think, I mean, we all know this phenomenon. I mean, what we say of someone, you know, that person's too online, right? Like what does it mean to be too online? And where do you draw that boundary? You know, how do you know? What constitutes being too online? Well, in some sense, just, I think being on social media at all is to be too online. I mean, given what it does to, given the kinds of information, it signal boosts and given the impulse it kindles in each of us to reach out to our audience in specific mo moments and\nin specific ways, right? It's like, there are lots of moments now where I have an opinion about something, but there's nothing for me to\ndo with that opinion, right? Like there's no Twitter, right? So like, there are lots of\nthings that I would've tweeted in the last months that are not the kind\nof thing I'm gonna do a podcast about. I'm not gonna roll out 10 minutes on that topic on my podcast. I'm not gonna take the time\nto really think about it. But had I been on Twitter, I would've reacted to this thing in the news or this thing\nthat somebody did, right? - What do you do with that thought now? - I just let go of it. - Like chocolate ice cream is the most delicious thing ever. - Yeah, it's usually\nnot that sort of thing, but it's just, but then you look at the kinds of problems people create for themselves. You look at the life-deranging and reputation-destroying\nthings that people do. And I look at the things that have, the analogous things\nthat have happened to me. I mean, the things that have really bent my life around\nprofessionally over the past, you know, decade. So much of it is Twitter. I mean, honestly, in my case, almost 100% of it was Twitter. The controversies I would get into, the things I would think\nI would have to respond to in a, like I would release a\npodcast on a certain topic. I would see some blow-back on Twitter. You know, it would give me the sense that there was some signal that\nI really had to respond to. Now that I'm off Twitter, I recognize that most of that was just, it was totally speeches, right? It was not something I had to respond to. But yet I would then do a\ncycle of podcasts responding to that thing that like, taking my foot outta my mouth or taking someone else's\nfoot outta my mouth.

And I would never have\nheard from this person in any other format. And now I'm actually\nin dialogue with them. And it's fantastic. That's the promise of it,\nto actually talk to people. And so I kept getting\nlured back into that. No, the way the sane or, you know, sanity preserving-way of using it is just as a marketing channel. You just put your stuff out there and you don't look at\nwhat's coming back at you. And that's, you know, for, you know, I'm on other\nsocial media platforms that I don't even touch. I mean, my team posts stuff\non Facebook and on Instagram. I never even see what's on there. - So you don't think it's\npossible to see something and not let it affect your mind? - No, that's definitely possible. But the question is, and I did that for vast\nstretches of time, right? But then the promise of the platform is dialogue and feedback, right? So why am I, if I know,\nfor whatever reason, I'm gonna see like 99 to 1 awful feedback, you know, bad faith feedback, malicious feedback, some\nof it's probably even bots, and I'm not even aware of who's\na person who's a bot, right? But I'm just gonna stare\ninto this funhouse mirror of acrimony and dishonesty that is going to, I mean, the reason why I got off is, not because I couldn't recalibrate and find equanimity again with all the nastiness that was coming back at me, and not that I couldn't ignore\nit for vast rushes of time, but I could see that I\nkept coming back to it, hoping that it would be\nsomething that I could use, a real tool for communication. And I was noticing that it was insidiously changing the way I felt about people, both people I know and\npeople I don't know, right? Like people, you know, mutual friends of ours who are behaving in certain ways on Twitter,\nwhich just seemed insane to me. And then that became a\nsignal I felt like I had to take into account somehow, right? You're seeing people at their worst, both friends and strangers. And I felt that it was, as much as I could sorta\ntry to recalibrate for it, I felt that I was losing touch with what was real information,\nbecause people are performing, people are faking, people\nare not themselves, or you're seeing people at their worst. And so I felt like, all right, what's being advertised to me here on a, not just a daily basis, you know, an hourly basis or, you know, an increment sometimes of, you\nknow, multiple times an hour. I mean, I probably\nchecked Twitter, you know, at minimum 10 times a day. And maybe I was checking\nit a hundred times a day on some days, right? Where things were really active and I was really engaged with something. What was being delivered\ninto my brain there was suddenly false information about how dishonest and, you know, just generally unethical, totally normal people are\ncapable of being, right? It was like it is a funhouse mirror. I was seeing the most\ngrotesque versions of people who I know, right? People who I know I could\nsit down at dinner with and they would never behave this way.

Like if you go paintballing,\nif you, Jordan Peterson and, you ever go paintballing\n- You're gonna shoot your friends, yeah. - Yeah, you're gonna shoot your friends, but you kind of accept that that's kinda what you're doing in this\nlittle game that you're playing, but it's sometimes hard to\nremind yourself of that. - Well, and I think I was\nguilty of that, definitely. You know, I don't think, there's nothing, I don't think\nI ever did anything that I really feel bad about, but yeah, it was always pushing me to\nthe edge of snideness somehow. And it's just not healthy, it's not, so the reason why I\ndeleted my Twitter account in the end was that it\nwas obviously making me a worse person. And so, and yeah, is there some way to be on there where it's not making you a worse person? I'm sure there is, but it's, given the\nnature of the platform, and given what was\ncoming back at me on it, the way to do that is\njust to basically use it as a one-way channel of communication. Just marketing, you know? It's like, here's what\nI'm paying attention to. Look at it if you want to,\nand you just push it out, and then you don't look at\nwhat's coming back at you. - I put out a call for\nquestions on Twitter, and then actually, quite surprising, there's a lot of good, I mean, they're like,\neven if they're critical, they're like being\nthoughtful, which is nice. - I used it that way too and\nthat was what kept me hooked. - But then there's also Touch Balls 69 wrote a question, \"Ask- - I can't imagine, this is part of it, but one way to solve this is, you know, we've gotta get rid of\nanonymity for this, it's like- - Let me ask the question,\n\"Ask Sam why he sucks,\" was the question. - Yeah, that's good. Well, one reason why I sucked was Twitter. That was, and I've since\nsolved that problem. So Touch Ball, what's that? - 69.\n- 69. - [Lex] Yeah. - Touch Ball 69 should be happy that I suck a little bit less now that I'm off Twitter. - I mean, the fact-\n- I don't have to hear from Touch Ball 69 on the regular. (Lex chuckling) - The fact that you have to see that, it probably can have a negative effect, just even in moderation, just to see that there is, like for me, the negative effect is\nslightly losing faith in the underlying kindness of humanity. - [Sam] Yeah, that was for me, yeah. You can also just reason\nyour way out of it saying that this is an anonymity\nand this is kind of fun, and this is kind of just\nthe shit show of Twitter, it's okay, but it does mentally\naffect you a little bit. - Like I don't read too much\ninto that kind of comment. It's like it's just, that's just trolling and it's, you know, I understand the fun the person is having on the other side of that. It's like-\n- Do you though? - Well, I do, I mean, I\ndon't behave that way, but I do and for all I know, that person could be, you\nknow, 16 years old, right? So it's like. - It could be also an altered\ncon for Elon, I don't know. - Well, yeah, that's\nright, yeah, yeah, yeah. (Lex laughing) No, I'm pretty sure Elon would\njust tweet that, you know, under his own name at this point. (Lex laughing) - Oh man, but you love each other. Okay, so do you think,\nso speaking of which, now that Elon has taken over Twitter, is there something that he could do to make this platform better? This Twitter and just\nsocial media in general, but because of the aggressive nature of his innovation that he's pushing, is there any way to make Twitter a pleasant place for Sam Harris? - Maybe.\n- Like in the next five years? Yeah, I don't know. I think I'm agnostic\nas to whether or not he or anyone could make a\nsocial media platform that really was healthy.",

I mean, it's obviously, I mean, he is not going to admit it, but I think it's obviously\nnegative for Elon, right? I mean, it's just not, and that was one of the\nthings that, you know, when I was looking into\nthe funhouse mirror, I was also seeing the funhouse mirror on his side of Twitter and it was just even more exaggerated. It's like when I was asking myself, why is he spending his time this way? I then reflected on why, you know, why was I spending my time this way, to a lesser degree, right? And at lesser scale. And at lesser risk,\nfrankly, right, and so, and it was just so, it's not just Twitter. I mean, this is in part\nan internet phenomenon. It's like the whole Hunter\nBiden mess that you... - Explored?\n- Explored. (Lex laughing) That was based on, I mean, I was on somebody's podcast, but that was based on a clip\ntaken from that podcast, which was highly as misleading as to the general shape of my\nremarks on that podcast. Even, you know, I had to then do my own\npodcast untangling all of that and admitting that even\nin the full context, I was not speaking especially well and didn't say exactly what\nI thought in a way that would've been recognizable\nto anyone, you know, even someone with, not functioning\nby a spirit of charity. But the clip was quite distinct\nfrom the podcast itself. The reality is is that we're living in an\nenvironment now where people are so lazy and their attention is so fragmented that they only have time for clips, but 99% of people will see a clip and will assume there's\nno relevant context I need to understand what happened\nin that clip, right? And obviously the people who make those clips know that, right? And they're doing it quite maliciously. And in this case, the person who made that\nclip and subsequent clips of other podcasts was\nquite maliciously trying to engineer, you know, some reputational emulation for me. And being signal boosted by Elon and other prominent people who can't take the time to watch\nanything other than a clip, even when it's their friend or someone who's ostensibly their\nfriend in that clip, right? So it's a total failure, an understandable failure of ethics, that everyone is so short on time and they're so fucking lazy that, and we now have these\ncontexts in which we react so quickly to things, right? Like Twitter is inviting an instantaneous reaction\nto this clip that is just too tempting to just say something and not know what you're\neven commenting on. And most of the people who\nsaw that clip don't understand what I actually think\nabout any of these issues. And the irony is people are gonna find clips\nfrom this conversation that are just as misleading,\nand they're gonna export those, and then people are gonna\nbe dunking on those clips. And, you know, we're all\nliving and dying by clips now, and it's dysfunctional. - See, I think it's possible\nto create a platform. I think we will keep living\non clips, but, you know, when I saw that clip of\nyou talking about children, and so on, just knowing that\nyou have a sense of humor, you just went to a dark\nplace in terms of humor. - Right.\n- So like I didn't even bother. And then I knew that the way clips work is that people will use\nit for virality sake, but giving a person benefit of the doubt, that's not even the right term. It's not like I was... It was really like interpreting it in the context of knowing your past. - The truth is you even need, like I even give Trump the benefit of the doubt when I see a clip of Trump. And so, 'cause there are\nfamous clips of Trump that are very misleading as to what he was saying in context, and I've been honest about that. Like the whole, you know, there were good people on both sides, scandal around the, his remarks after Charlottesville, the clip that got exported and got promoted by everyone, you know, left of center,\nfrom Biden on down, you know, the New York Times, CNN, there's nobody that I'm aware of who has honestly, you know, apologized for\nwhat they did with that clip. He did not say what he seemed\nto be saying in that clip about the Nazis at Charlottesville, right? And I have always been\nvery clear about that. So it's just, you know,",

There was no context. I mean, that's a\nmisinformation apocalypse. that we are right on the cusp of. And, you know, it's terrifying. - Well, it could be just a new world like where Alice going to Wonderland where humor is the only thing we have and that will save us. Maybe in the end, Trump's approach to social media was the right one after all. Nothing is true and everything is absurd. - Yeah, but we can't live that way.

They think, you know-\n- People have functioned. - Well, to do anything, it's like, I mean, you have to know what you\nthink is gonna happen, or you have to at least give\na probabilistic weighting over the future. Otherwise you're gonna\nbe incapacitated by, you're not gonna, like\npeople want certain things, and they have to have a rational plan to get those desires gratified. And they don't wanna die. They don't want their kids to die. You tell them that there's a\ncomet hurling toward Earth, and they should get\noutside and look up, right? They're gonna do it. And if it turns out it's\nmisinformation, you know, it's gonna matter, because\nit comes down to like, what medicines do you\ngive your children, right?

And if it's not credible, if it's not persuasive now to most people, I mean, honestly, I\ndon't think we're gonna, I'll be amazed if it's a year before we can actually create journal articles, that it would take, you know, a PhD to debunk that are completely fake. And there are people who are\ncelebrating this kind of, you know, coming cataclysm. But it's just, they're the people who don't have anything to\nlose who are celebrating it or just are so confused, that they just don't even\nknow what's at stake. And then there are the people who have, the few people who we\ncould count on a few hands who have managed to insulate themselves, or at least imagine they've\ninsulated themselves from the downside here enough that they're not implicated\nin the great unraveling we are witnessing or could witness. - The shaking up of what is true, so actually that returns us to experts. Do you think experts can save us? Is there such thing as expertise\nand experts at something? How do you know if you've achieved it? - I think it's important\nto acknowledge upfront that there's something paradoxical\nabout how we relate to authority, especially within science. And I don't think that\nparadox is going away, and it's just, it doesn't\nhave to be confusing. And it's not truly a paradox. It's just like there are\ndifferent moments in time. So it is true to say that within science or within rationality generally, I mean, just whenever you're having a fact-based discussion about anything, it is true to say that the\ntruth or falsity of a statement does not even slightly\ndepend on the credentials of the person making the statement, right? So it doesn't matter if\nyou're a Nobel Laureate, you can be wrong, right? The thing you could, either the last sentence you spoke could be total bullshit, right? And it's also possible for someone who's deeply uninformed to\nbe right about something or to be right for the\nwrong reasons, right? Or someone just gets lucky or someone, and they're middling\ncases where you have like a backyard astronomer\nwho's got no credentials, but he just loves astronomy\nand he's got a telescope and he spends a lot of time\nlooking at the night sky, and he discovers a comet\nthat no one else has seen. You know, not even the\nprofessional expert astronomers. And, my God, I think that\nhappens less and less now, but some version of that keeps happening and it may always keep\nhappening in every area of expertise, right?",

But it is also true that most of the time, real experts are much more reliable than frauds or people who\nare not experts, right, And expertise really is a thing, right? And when, you know, when you're flying an airplane in a storm, you don't want just randos\ncome into the cockpit saying, listen, I've got a new idea\nabout how to, you know, how we should tweak these controls, right? You want someone who's a trained pilot and that training gave\nthem something, right? It gave them a set of\ncompetences and intuitions and they know what all those\ndials and switches do, right? And I don't, right? I shouldn't be flying that plane. So when things really matter, you know, and putting this at 30,000 feet\nin a storm sharpens this up, we want real experts\nto be in charge, right? And we are at 30,000 feet a lot of the time on a\nlot of issues, right? And whether they're public health issues, whether it's a geopolitical\nemergency like Ukraine, I mean, the climate change, I\nmean, just pick your topic, there are real problems and the clock is rather often ticking and their solutions\nare non-obvious, right? And so expertise is a thing and deferring to experts\nmuch of the time makes a lot of sense. At minimum, it prevents, you know, spectacular\nerrors of incompetence and just, you know, foolhardiness. But even in the case of some, where you're talking\nabout someone, I mean, people like ourselves who are\nlike, we're well-educated. We're not the worst\npossible candidates for, you know, the Dunning-Kruger effect. When we're going into a new\narea where we're not experts, we're fairly alert to the\npossibility that we don't, you know, it's not as simple\nas things seem at first. And we don't, you know, we don't know how our tools\ntranslate to this new area. We can be fairly\ncircumspect, but we're also, because we're well-educated, and we're pretty quick studies, we can learn a lot of things pretty fast, and we can begin to play a language game that sounds fairly expert, right? And in that case, the invitation to do your\nown research, right, is in, when times are good, I view as an invitation to waste your time pointlessly, right? When times are good. Now the truth is times are\nnot all that good, right? And we have the ongoing public display\nof failures of expertise. We have experts who\nare obviously corrupted by bad incentives. We've got experts who, you know, perversely won't admit they\nwere wrong when they in fact, you know, are demonstrated to be wrong. We've got institutions\nthat have been captured by political ideology\nthat's not truth-tracking. I mean, this whole woke encroachment into really every place, you know, whether it's\nuniversities or science journals or government or, I mean, it's just like, that has been genuinely deranging. So there's a lot going on where experts and the very concept\nof expertise has seemed to discredit itself, but the reality is is that there is a massive difference, when anything matters, when there's anything\nto know about anything, there is a massive\ndifference most of the time between someone who has\nreally done the work to understand that domain\nand someone who hasn't. And if I get sick or someone close to me gets sick, you know, I have a PhD\nin neuroscience, right? So I can read a medical journal article and understand a lot of it, right? And, you know, so I'm just\nfairly conversant with, you know, medical terminology\nand I understand its methods, and I'm alert to the difference,\nbecause I've, you know, because in neuroscience, I've spent hours and hours\nin journal clubs, you know, diagnosing, you know, and analyzing the difference\nbetween good and bad studies, I'm alert to the difference\nbetween good and bad studies in medical journals, right? I understand that bad studies\ncan get published and, you know, et cetera. And experiments can be poorly designed. I'm alert to all of those things, but when I get sick or when\nsomeone close to me gets sick, I don't pretend to be a doctor, right? I've got no clinical experience.",

And if I decide, if I had a lot of runway,\nif I decided, okay, it's really important for\nme to know everything I can, at this point, I know\nsomeone's gonna get cancer. I may not go back to school\nand become an oncologist, but what I wanna do is I wanna know everything I\ncan know about cancer, right? So I'm gonna take the next\nfour years and spend most of my time on cancer. Okay, I could do that, right? I still think that's a waste of my time. I still think at the end of, even at the end of those four years, I'm not gonna be the best person to form intuitions about\nwhat to do in the face of the next cancer that\nI have to confront. I'm still gonna want a better\noncologist than I've become to tell me what he or she would do if they were in my shoes\nor in the shoes of, you know, my family member. You know, what I'm not advocating, I'm not advocating a blind trust in authority. Like if you get cancer and you're talking to one oncologist and they're recommending some course of treatment, by all means get a second opinion, get a third opinion, right? But it matters that\nthose opinions are coming from real experts and not from, you know, Robert Kennedy Jr, you know, who's telling you that, you know, you got it because you got a,\nyou know, a vaccine, right? It's like, it's just, we're swimming in a sea of misinformation where you've got people who are moving the opinions\nof millions of others who should not have an\nopinion on these topics. Like there is no scenario in which you should be\ngetting your opinion about vaccine safety or climate change, or the war in Ukraine or anything else that we might wanna talk about\nfrom Candace Owens, right? It's just like she's not a relevant expert\non any of those topics. And what's more, she\ndoesn't seem to care, right? And she's living in a culture that has amplified that not caring\ninto a business model and an effective business model, right? So it's just, and there's something very\nTrumpian about all that. Like that's the, you know, the problem is the culture. It's not these specific individuals. So the paradox here is that\nexpertise is a real thing, and we defer to it a lot as a labor-saving device. And it's just based on the reality that it's very\nhard to be a polymath, right? And specialization is a thing, right? And so there are people who specialize in a very narrow topic, they know more about that\ntopic than the next guy, no matter how smart that guy or gal is. And that those differences matter. But it's also true that when you're talking\nabout facts, sometimes the best experts are wrong. The scientific consensus is wrong. You get a sea change in the thinking of a whole field because\none person who's an outlier for whatever reason decides, okay, you know, I'm gonna prove this point, and they prove it, right? So somebody like the doctor who believed that stomach ulcers\nwere not due to stress, but were due to H.\npylori infections, right? So he just drank a vial\nof H. pylori bacteria and proved, and quickly got an ulcer, and convinced the field that at minimum, H. pylori\nwas involved in that process. Okay, so yes, everyone was wrong. That doesn't disprove the reality of expertise. It doesn't disprove the utility of relying on experts most of the time,\nespecially in an emergency, especially when the clock is ticking, especially when, you know, you're in this particular cockpit and you only have one chance\nto land this plane, right? You want the real pilot at the controls. - But there's just a few things to say. - [Sam] Go. - (sighs) So one, you mentioned this example with cancer and doing your own research.

                "text": "the internet made information\na lot more accessible, so you can read a lot of\ndifferent meta-analyses. You can read blog posts\nthat describe to you exactly the flaws and the different papers that make up the meta-analyses. And you can read a lot of those blog posts that are conflicting with each other and you can take that information in, and in a short amount of time, you can start to make good faith interpretations. For example, I don't know, I don't wanna overstate things, but if you suffer from\ndepression, for example, then you could go to an expert and a doctor that prescribes\nyou some medication, but you could also challenge\nsome of those ideas and seeing like, what are\nthe different medications? What are the different side effects, what are the different\nsolutions to depression? All that kind of stuff. And I think depression is just\na really difficult problem that's very, I don't wanna,\nagain, state incorrect things, but I think there's a lot of variability of what depression really means. So being introspective about\nthe type of depression you have and the different possible\nsolutions you have, just doing your own\nresearch as a first step before approaching a doctor or as you have multiple opinions, could be very beneficial in that case. Now that's depression. That's something that's been\nstudied for a very long time. With a new pandemic that's\naffecting everybody, you know, with the airplane\nequated to like 9/11 or something, like the new\nemergency just happened and everybody, every expert in\nthe world is publishing on it and talking about it. So doing your own research there could be exceptionally\neffective in asking questions. And then there's a difference\nbetween experts, virologists, and it's actually a good question, who is exactly the expert in a pandemic? - [Sam] Yeah. - But there's the actual experts doing the research and publishing stuff, and then there's the\ncommunicators of that expertise. And the question is if the communicators are flawed to a degree where doing your own research is actually the more effective way to figure out policies and solutions, because you're not competing with experts. You're competing with the\ncommunicators of expertise. That could be WHO, CDC in\nthe case of the pandemic, or politicians or political type of science figures like Anthony Fauci. There's a question there of the effectiveness of doing your research, your own research in that context. And the competing forces there, incentives that you've mentioned, is you can become quite\npopular by being contrarian, by saying everybody's lying to you, all the authorities are lying to you, all the institutions are lying to you. So those are the waters\nyou're swimming in, but I think doing your own research in that kind of context\ncould be quite effective. - Let me be clear. I'm not saying you shouldn't\ndo any research, right? I'm not saying that you shouldn't be informed about an issue. I'm not saying you shouldn't read articles on whatever the topic is. And, yes, if I got cancer or\nsomeone close to me got cancer, I probably would read more about cancer than I've read thus far about cancer. And I've read some. So I'm not making a virtue of ignorance and of blind obedience to authority. And again, I recognize that authorities can discredit themselves, or they can be wrong,\nthey can be wrong even when there's no discredit. There's a lot we don't understand about the nature of the world. But still this vast gulf between truly informed opinion and bullshit exists. It always exists. And conspiracy thinking is rather often, you know, most of the time, a species of bullshit, but it's not always wrong, right? There are real conspiracies and there really are just awful corruptions of, you know, born of bad\nincentives within our, you know, our scientific processes,\nwithin institutions. And again, we've mentioned a\nlot of these things in passing, but, you know, what woke political ideology did to scientific communication\nduring the pandemic was awful. And it was really\ncorrosive of public trust, especially on the right,\nfor understandable reasons. I mean, it was just, it was crazy, some of the things that were\nbeing said, and still is. And these cases are all different. Something like, you take depression. We just don't know enough\nabout depression for, you know, anyone to be that confident\nabout anything, right? And there are many different\nmodalities in which to interact with it as a problem, right?",

But again, depression is\na multifactorial problem, and there are different levels\nat which to influence it. And there, you know, there\nare things like meditation, there are things like\njust life changes and, you know, one of the first\nthings about depression is that when you're depressed, all of the things that\nwould be good for you to do are precisely the things\nyou don't wanna do. You don't have any energy to socialize. You don't wanna get things done, you don't wanna exercise, you don't. And all of those things, if\nyou got those up and running, they do make you feel better,\nyou know, in the aggregate. But the reality is is there're, you know, there are clinical level\ndepressions that are so bad that it's just, we just don't\nhave good tools for them. And it's not enough to tell, there's no life change\nsomeone's gonna embrace that is going to be an\nobvious remedy for that. I mean, pandemics are obviously\na complicated problem, but I would consider it\nmuch simpler than depression in terms of, you know, what's on the menu to be this chosen among the various choices. - Just less multifactorial.\n- The logic by which you would make those choices, yeah. So it's like we have a\nvirus, we have a new virus, it's some version of bad, you know, it's human-transmissible. We're still catching up, we're catching up to every aspect of- - We don't know how it spreads. We don't know how... - How effective masks are.\n- Well, at a certain point, we knew it was respiratory but. - But how respiratory-\n- But yeah. And whether it spread\nby fomites and like all, we were confused about a lot of things. And we're still confused. It's been a moving target this whole time, and it's been changing this whole time. And our responses to\nit have been, you know, we ramped up the vaccines\nas quickly as we could, but, you know, too quick for some, not quick enough for others. We could've done human challenge trials and got them out more\nquickly with better data. And I think that's something\nwe should probably look at in the future, because, you know, to my eye that would make ethical sense to do challenge trials. And so much of my concern\nabout COVID, I mean, many people are confused\nabout my concern about COVID. My concern about COVID\nhas, for much of the time, not been narrowly focused on COVID itself, how dangerous I perceive\nCOVID to be as a illness. It has been for the longest time even more a concern about\nour ability to respond to a truly scary pathogen next time. Like I, for, you know, outside those initial months, you know, give me the first six months\nto be quite worried about COVID and the unraveling of society but. - And the supply of toilet paper. - You wanna secure a steady\nsupply of toilet paper. But beyond that initial period, when we had a sense of\nwhat we were dealing with, and we had every hope that the vaccines are actually gonna work and we knew we were getting those vaccines in short order, right? Beyond that, and we\nknew just how dangerous the illness was and how\ndangerous it wasn't. For years now, I've just\nbeen worrying about this as a failed dress rehearsal for\nsomething much worse, right? I think what we proved to ourselves at this moment in history is that we have built informational tools that we do not know how to use, and we have made ourselves, we've basically enrolled\nall of human society into a psychological experiment that is deranging us and making it virtually impossible to solve coordination problems that we absolutely have to solve next time when things are worse. - Do you understand who's at fault for the way this unraveled? The way we didn't seem to have the distrust in institutions, in the institution of science that grew like seemingly exponentially or got revealed through this process. Who is at fault here? And what's the fix? - So much blame to go around, but so much of it is not a matter of bad people conspiring to do bad things. It's a matter of incompetence and misaligned incentives and just ordinary, you know, just\nplain vanilla dysfunction. - But my problem was that people like you, people like Bret Weinstein, people like that I look to for reasonable difficult\nconversations on difficult topics have a little bit lost their mind,",

And then Kimbal Musk responded, I think something I think you\nprobably would agree with. Maybe not, \"I think it\nwas the combo of Trump and the pandemic. Trump triggered the far\nleft to be way more active than they could have been without him. And then the pandemic handed big government nanny state lefties a huge platform on a silver platter, a one-two punch, and here we are.\" - Well, I would agree with some of that. I'm not sure how much to read into the nanny state concept, but. - But yet like basically got people on the far left really activated - Yeah.\n- And then gave control to, I don't know if you say nanny state, but just control to government that when executed poorly, has created a complete\ndistrust in government. - My fear is that there was gonna be that complete distrust anyway, given the nature of the information space, given the level of conspiracy thinking, given the gaming of these tools by an anti-vax cult. I mean, there really is an anti-vax cult that just ramped up its energy during this moment. - But it's a small one. It's not to say that everything, every concern about vaccines is a species of, was born of misinformation, or born of this cult, but there is a cult that\nis just, you know, I mean, and, you know, the core\nof Trumpism is a cult. I mean, a QAnon on is a cult. And so there's a lot of lying and there's a lot of confusion. You know, there are, it's almost impossible to exaggerate how confused some people are and how fully their lives are organized\naround that confusion. I mean, there are people who think that the world's being run by\npedophile cannibals and that, you know, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama are\namong those cannibals. I mean, like they're\nadjacent to the pure crazy. There's the semi-crazy and\nadjacent to the semi-crazy, there's the grifting\nopportunist asshole and the layers of bad faith are, you know, hard to fully diagnose. But the problem is, all of this is getting signal boosted by an outrage machine that is preferentially\nspreading misinformation. It has a business model that is guaranteeing that is preferentially sharing misinformation. - Can I actually, just on a small tangent. - Yeah.\n- How do you defend yourself against the claim that you're a pedophile and cannibal? - It's difficult.\n- Here's the case I would make.\n- Yeah. Because I don't think you can use reason. I think you have to use empathy. You have to understand-\n- or, no, but what, like part of it, I mean I find it very difficult to believe that anyone\nbelieves these things. I mean, I think that there's, and there's, I'm sure there's some number of people who are just pretending to believe these things, because it's just, again, this is sort of like the\n4Chanification of everything. It's just Pepe the Frog, right? Like none of this is what it seems. They're not signaling an alliance with white\nsupremacy or neo-Nazism, but they're not not doing it. Like they just don't fucking care. It's just cynicism\noverflowing its banks, right? It's just fun to wind\nup the normies, right? Like look at all the\nnormies who don't understand that a green frog is just a green frog, even when it isn't just\na green frog, right? It's like that just, it's just gumming up everyone's cognitive bandwidth\nwith bullshit, right? I get that that's fun if you're a teenager and\nyou just wanna vandalize our news sphere, but at a certain point, we have to recognize that real questions of human welfare are in play, right? There's like, they're really, there're wars getting fought or not fought and there's a pandemic\nraging and there's medicine to take or not take. But, I mean, to come back\nto this issue of COVID, I don't think I got so\noutta balance around COVID. I think people are quite confused about what I was concerned about. I mean, like there was a, yes, there was a period where I was crazy, because anyone who was taking\nit seriously was crazy, 'cause they had no idea what was going on. And so it's like, yes, I was wiping down packages with alcohol wipes, right? Because people thought it was\ntransmissible by touch, right? And then when we realized\nthat was no longer the case, I stopped doing that. So again, it was a moving target, and a lot of things we did in hindsight around masking and school closures looked fairly dysfunctional,\nright, and unnecessary.",

                "text": "would say about your talking about COVID, and maybe you can correct me, but you were skeptical, or you were against skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. So people who get nervous\nabout the vaccine, but don't fall into the\nusual anti-vax camp, which I think there was a significant- - Yeah, yeah, there was.\n- Enough number. - Oh yeah.\n- They were asking, they were getting nervous. I mean, (chuckles) especially\nafter the war of Afghanistan and Iraq, I too was nervous about anything where a lot of money could be made. And you start, you just see how the\npeople who are greedy, they come to the surface all of a sudden, and then a lot of them\nthat run institutions actually are really good human beings. And I know a lot of them, but it's hard to know how\nthose two combine together when there's hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars to be made. And so that skepticism, I guess, the sense was that you weren't open enough to the skepticism. - I understand that\npeople have that sense. I'll tell you how I thought\nabout it and think about it. One, again, it was a moving target. So there was a point in the timeline where it was totally rational to expect that the vaccines were both working, both, they were reasonably safe. And that COVID was reasonably dangerous. And that the trade off\nfor basically everyone was it was rational to get vaccinated, given the level of testing and how many people had\nbeen vaccinated before you, given what we were\nseeing with COVID, right? That that was a forced\nchoice, are you thinking, you're eventually gonna get\nCOVID and the question is, do you wanna be vaccinated\nwhen you do, right? There was a period where\nthat forced choice, where it was just obviously\nreasonable to get vaccinated, especially because there was\nevery reason to expect that, while it wasn't a perfectly\nsterilizing vaccine, it was going to knock\ndown transmission a lot. And that matters. And so it wasn't just a personal choice. You were actually being a good citizen when you decided to run\nwhatever risk you were gonna run to get vaccinated. Because there are people in our society who actually can't get vaccinated. I mean, I know people who\ncan't take any vaccines. They're so allergic to, I mean, they, in their own person, seem to justify all of the\nfears of the anti-vax cult. I mean, it's like they're\nthe kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr.\ncan point to and say, see, vaccines will fucking kill you, right? Because of the experience and were still, I know people who have kids who\nfit that description, right? So we should all feel a\ncivic responsibility to be vaccinated against egregiously awful and transmissible diseases for which we have relatively safe vaccines to keep those sorts of people safe. - And there was a period of time when it was thought that the vaccine could stop transmission. - Yes, and so again, all\nof this has begun to shift. I don't think it has shifted as much as Bret Weinstein thinks it's shifted. But yes, there are safety\nconcerns around the mRNA vaccines, especially for young men, right? As far as I know, that's the purview of\nactual heightened concern. But also there's now, is a lot of natural immunity out there, basically everyone who's\ngonna get vaccinated, has gotten vaccinated. The virus has evolved to the point in this context, where\nit seems less dangerous. You know, again, I'm going\nmore on the seem-ins than on research that I've done at this point, but I'm certainly less\nworried about getting COVID. I've had it once, I've been vaccinated. It's like, so you ask me now, how do I feel about\ngetting the next booster? I don't know that I'm going to\nget the next booster, right? So I was somebody who was waiting in line at 04:00 in the morning, you know, hoping to get some overflow vaccine when it was first available. And that was, at that point, given what we knew, or given\nwhat I thought I knew based on the best sources I could\nconsult and based on, you know, based on anecdotes that were\ntoo vivid to ignore, you know, both data and personal experience, it was totally rational for me to wanna get that vaccine\nas soon as I could. And now I think it's totally\nrational for me to do a different kind of cost\nbenefit analysis and wonder, listen, do I really need\nto get a booster, right? You know, like, how many of\nthese boosters am I gonna get for the rest of my life, really?",

My concern is that at\nevery point along the way, I was the wrong person and Bret Weinstein was the wrong person, and there's many other people\nI could add to this list, to have strong opinions\nabout any of this stuff. - I just disagree with that. I think, yes, in theory, I agree 100%, but I feel like experts\nfailed at communicating. Not at doing\n- They did. - And I just feel like\nyou and Bret Weinstein actually have the tools with the internet, given the engine you have in your brain of thinking for months at a time, deeply about the problems\nthat face our world, that you actually have the tools to do pretty good thinking here. You see, the problem I have with experts- - But there would be deference to experts and pseudo-experts behind all of that. - Well, the papers, you would stand on the\nshoulders of giants, but you can surf those shoulders better than the giants themselves. - Yeah, but I knew we were\ngonna disagree about the, like I saw his podcast where\nhe brought on these experts who had, many of them had\nthe right credentials, but for variety of reasons, they didn't pass the smell test for me. Maybe one larger problem, and this goes back to the problem of how we rely on authority in science, is that you can always find a PhD or an MD to champion any crackpot idea, right? I mean, it is amazing, but you could find PhDs and\nMDs who would sit up there in front of Congress and say that they thought smoking\nwas not addictive, you know, or that it was not harmful to, there was no direct link\nbetween smoking and lung cancer. You could always find those people. But, you know, some of the people Bret found were people who had obvious tells to my\npoint of view, to my eye. I mean, and I saw them on, some of the same people were\non Rogan's podcast, right? And it's hard because if a person does have\nthe right credentials and they're not saying\nsomething floridly mistaken, and we're talking about something where they're genuine unknowns, right? Like how much do we know about the safety of these vaccines, right? It's, at that point, not\na whole hell of a lot. I mean, we have no long-term\ndata on mRNA vaccines. But to confidently say that\nmillions of people are gonna die because of these vaccines, and to confidently say that\nivermectin is a panacea, right? Ivermectin is the thing\nthat prevents COVID, right? There was no good reason to\nsay either of those things at that moment. And so given that that's where Bret was, I felt like there was just no, there was nothing to debate. We're both the wrong people to be getting into the weeds on this. We're both gonna defer\nto our chosen experts. His experts look like crackpots to me and, or at least the ones\nwho are most vociferous on those edgiest points that seem most... - And your experts seem\nlike, what is the term? Mass hysteria, I forgot the term. - Well, it's, no, but it's like with, you know, climate science. I mean, there's this old, it's received as a canard in half of our society now, but the claim that 97% of\nclimate scientists agree that human cause climate\nchange is a thing, right? So do you go with the 97% most of the time or do you go with the 3% most of the time? It's obvious you go with the 97% most of the time for anything that matters. It's not to say that\nthe 3% are always wrong. Again there are, things get overturned. And yes, as you say, and I've spent much more\ntime worrying about this on my podcast than I've\nspent worrying about COVID, our institutions have lost trust for good reason, right? And it's an open question whether we can actually get things done with this level of transparency and pseudo-transparency, given\nour information ecosystems. Like can we fight a war, really fight a war that\nwe may have to fight, like the next Nazis? Can we fight that war when\neveryone with an iPhone is showing just how awful it is that little girls get blown up when we drop our bombs, right? It's like, could we as a society\ndo what we might have to do to actually get necessary things done when we're living in this\npanopticon of just, you know, everyone's a journalist, right? Everyone's a scientist,\neveryone's an expert. Everyone's got direct\ncontact with the facts or semblance of the facts, I don't know. - I think yes, and I think voices like yours\nare exceptionally important and I think there's certain\nsignals you send in your ability",

And then if you become a\ntrusted person that's able to consider the other side, then people will listen to you as the aggregator, as the\ncommunicator of expertise. 'Cause the virologists haven't been able to be good communicators. I still, to this day, don't really know what is the, (chuckling) what am I supposed to\nthink about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines today? As it stands today, what\nare we supposed to think? What are we supposed\nto think about testing? What are we supposed to\nthink about the effectiveness of masks or lockdowns? Where's the great communicators\non this topic that, consider all the other\nconspiracy theories, all the communication that's out there and actually aggregating it together and be able to say, this is actually what's\nmost likely the truth. And also some of that has to do with humility, epistemic humility, knowing that you can't\nreally know for sure, just like with depression, you\ncan't really know for sure. - Yeah.\n- Like where is the, I'm not seeing those communications being effectively done, even still today. - Well, I mean the jury is\nstill out on some of it, and again, it's a moving target. And some of it, I mean, it's complicated. Some of it's a\nself-fulfilling dynamic where, so like lockdowns, in theory, a lockdown would work\nif we could only do it, but we can't really do it. And there's a lot of\npeople who won't do it, because they're convinced that this is the totalitarian boot, you know, on finally on the neck of the good people who are always having their interests, you know, introduced by the elites, right?

Is just code for the\nnew world order coming to fuck you over and\ntake your guns, right? Okay, you have a society\nthat is now immune to reason, right? 'Cause there are absolutely\ncertain pathogens that we should lock down\nfor next time, right? And it was completely rational in the beginning of\nthis thing to lock down, to attempt to lock down, we never really locked down, to attempt some semblance of\na lockdown just to, quote, bend the curve to spare\nour healthcare system, given what we were seeing\nhappen in Italy, right? Like that moment was not hard to navigate, at least in my view. It was obvious at the time. In retrospect, my views on\nthat haven't changed except for the fact that I recognize maybe it's just impossible, given the nature of people's response to\nthat kind of demand, right? We live in a society that's\njust not gonna lock down. - Unless the pandemic is much more deadly. - Right, so that's the point\nI made, which, you know, was maliciously clipped\nout from some other podcast where someone was trying\nto make it look like I wanna see children die, it's a pity more children\ndidn't die from COVID, right? This is actually the same person who and that's the other thing\nthat got so poisoned here. It's like that person, this psychopath or effective psychopath who's creating these\nclips of me on podcasts, the second clip of me seeming to say that I wish more children\ndied during COVID, but it was so clear in context, what I was saying, that even\nthe clip betrayed the context, so it didn't actually work. This psycho, and again, I don't know whether he\nactually is a psychopath, but he's behaving like one, because of the incentives of Twitter. This is somebody who Bret signal boosted as a very reliable source\nof information, right? He kept retweeting this guy\nat me, against me, right? And this guy, at one glance, I knew how unreliable this guy was, right? But I think I'm not at all set, one thing I think I did wrong,\none thing that I do regret, one thing I have not sorted out for myself is how to navigate the professional and\npersonal pressure that gets applied at this moment\nwhere you have a friend or an acquaintance or someone you know who's behaving badly in\npublic or behaving badly, behaving in a way that you\nthink is bad in public. And they have a public platform where they're influencing a lot of people and you have your own public platform where you're constantly\ngetting asked to comment on what this this friend or acquaintance or colleague is doing.",

Because my case would be,\nbeforehand and now still, the case I would like, and this part of the\ncriticism you sent my way, maybe it's useful to go to that direction. Actually, let's go to that direction, because I think I disagree\nwith your criticism as you stated publicly, but this is- - Are you talking of your interview with Kanye?\n- Kanye, yeah, yeah. The thing you criticized me for is actually the right thing\nto do with Bret, okay. You said, \"Lex could have\nspoken with Kanye in such a way as to have produced a useful document. He didn't do that because he\nhas a fairly naive philosophy about the power of love.\" (Lex chuckling) - Let's see if you can\nmaintain that philosophy in the present in the midst\n- Let's go. - Of criticism.\n- No, it's beautiful. He seemed to think that if he\njust got through the minefield to the end of the conversation\nwhere the two of them still were feeling good about one\nanother and they can hug it out, that would be, by definition, a success. So lemme make the case for this power of love philosophy, right? And first of all, I love you, Sam. You're still an inspiration and somebody I deeply admire, okay. - [Sam] Back at you. - (chuckles) To me, in the case of Kanye, it's not only that you get\nthrough the conversation and have hugs, it's that the display that you're willing to do that has power. So even if it doesn't end\nin hugging, the actual, the turning the other cheek, the act of turning the other\ncheek itself communicates both to Kanye later, and to\nthe rest of the world, that we should have empathy and compassion towards each other. There is power to that. Maybe that is naive, but I believe in the power of that. So it's not that I'm\ntrying to convince Kanye that some of his ideas are wrong, but I'm trying to illustrate\nthat just the act of listening and truly trying to\nunderstand the human being, that opens people's minds to actually questioning\ntheir own beliefs more. It takes them out of the dogmatism, it deescalates the kind of\ndogmatism that I've been seeing. So in that sense, I would\nsay the power of love is the philosophy you might apply to Bret, because the right conversation\nyou have in private is not about, hey, listen, you know, the experts you're talking to, they seem credentialed, but they're not actually as credentialed as they illustrating, they're not grounding their\nfindings in actual meta-analysis and papers, and so on. Like making a strong case, like what are you doing? This is gonna get a lot\nof people in trouble. But instead just saying like, being a friend in the dumbest of ways, being like respectful, sending love their way, and just having a conversation\noutside of all of this, like basically showing that like removing the emotional\nattachment to this debate. Even though you are very\nemotionally attached, because in the case of COVID specifically, there is a very large\nnumber of lives at stake. But removing all of that and remembering that you have a friendship. - Yeah, well, so I think these are highly non-analogous cases, right? So your conversation with Kanye misfired, from my point of view, for\na very different reason. And it was, it has to do with Kanye. I mean, so Kanye, I don't know,",

                "text": "but I think he's either obviously in the midst of a mental health crisis or he's a colossal asshole, or both. I mean, actually those\naren't mutually exclusive. So one of three possibility. But he's either mentally ill, he's an asshole, or he's\nmentally ill and an asshole. - I think all three of those\npossibilities are possible for the both of us as well. - No.\n- At the moment. I would argue none of those\nare likely for either of us, but.\n- Possible. - Not to say we don't\nhave our moments but. So the reason not to talk to Kanye, so I think you should've had the conversation you\nhad with him in private. That's great, and I've got no\ncriticism of what you said, had it been in private. In public, I just thought\nyou're not doing him a favor, if he's mentally ill, right? If he's in the middle\nof a manic episode or, you know, I'm not a\nclinician, but, you know, I've heard it said of\nhim that he is bipolar. You're not doing him a favor\nsticking a mic in front of him and letting him go off on the\nJews or anything else, right? We know what he thought about the Jews. We know that there's not much illumination that's gonna come from him on that topic. And if it is a symptom\nof his mental illness that he thinks these things, well, then you're not doing\nhim a favor making that even more public. If he's just an asshole and he's just an anti-Semite, an ordinary, you know, garden variety anti-Semite, well, then there's also not much to say unless you're really gonna dig in and kick the shit out of him in public. And I'm saying you can do that with love. I mean, that's the other thing here, is that I don't agree that compassion and love always have this patient, embracing acquiescent face, right? They they don't always feel\ngood to the recipient, right? There is a sword of wisdom that you can wield compassionately in moments like that where\nsomeone's full of shit and you just make it\nabsolutely clear to them and to your audience that\nthey're full of shit. And there's no hatred being communicated. In fact, you could just like, listen, I'm gonna do everyone a favor\nright now and, you know, just take your foot out of your mouth. And the truth is, you know, I just wouldn't have\naired the conversation. Like I just don't think it was a document that had to get out there, right? I get that many, this is not a signal you're likely to get from your audience, right? Like I get that many people\nin your audience thought, oh my God, that's awesome. You're talking to Kanye and\nyou're doing it in Lex style where it's just love and\nyou're not treating him like a pariah and, you know, you're holding this tension between he's this creative\ngenius who his work we love, and yet he's having this\nmoment that's so painful and what a tightrope walk and, I get that maybe 90% of your\naudience saw it that way. They're still wrong and I still think that was, on balance, not a good thing to\nput out into the world. - You don't think it opens up the mind and heart of people that listen to that? Just seeing a person-\n- If it does, if it's opening it up\nin the wrong direction where just gale force\nnonsense is coming in, right? I think we should have an\nopen mind and an open heart, but there's some clear things here that we have to keep in view. One is the mental illness\ncomponent is its own thing. I don't pretend to understand\nwhat's going on with him. But insofar as that's\nthe reason he's saying what he's saying, do not put this guy on camera and let- - But I had, sorry, on\nthat point real quick, I had a bunch of\nconversations with him offline and I didn't get a\nsense of mental illness. So that's why I chose to sit down. - Okay.\n- And I didn't get it, I mean, mental illness is such a. - But when he shows up in a gimp hood on Alex Jones's podcast, I mean, either that's more, you know, genius performance in his world or he's unraveling further. - I wouldn't put that\nunder mental illness. We have to, I think there's another\nconversation to be had about how we treat artists. - [Sam] Right. - Because they're weirdos. They're very, I mean, you know, (chuckles) taking words from a Kanye as if he's like Christopher Hitchens\nor something like that, like very eloquent, researched, you know, written many books on history, on politics and\ngeopolitics, on psychology. Kanye didn't do any of that. He's an artist just spouting off. And so that's a different\nstyle conversation and different way to treat the words that are coming out of his mouth.\n- So let's leave the mental illness aside,\nso if we're gonna say that there's no reason to\nthink he's mentally ill, and this is just him being\ncreative and brilliant and opinionated, well, then that falls into the asshole bucket for me.",

                "text": "the most offensive thing\nabout him in that interview, from my point of view, is not the anti-Semitism, which, you know, we can talk about, 'cause I think there are\nproblems just letting him spread those memes as well. But the most offensive thing is just how delusional egocentric he is or was coming off in that interview and in others. Like he has an estimation of himself as this omnibus genius to not only to rival Shakespeare, to exceed Shakespeare, right? I mean, it's like he is the greatest mind that has ever walked among us. And he's more or less\nexplicit on that point. And yet he manages to talk for hours without saying\nanything actually interesting or insightful or factually\nilluminating, right? So it's complete delusion\nof a very Trumpian sort. You know, it's like, you know, when Trump says he's a genius who understands everything, but nobody takes him seriously, and one wonders whether Trump\ntakes himself seriously, Kanye seems to believe, he seems to believe his own press. He actually thinks he's, you know, just a colossus. And he may be a great musician. You know, I'm not, you know, it's certainly not my\nwheelhouse to compare him to any other musicians but one thing that's patently\nobvious from your conversation is he's not who he thinks\nhe is intellectually or ethically or in any other relevant way. And so when you couple that to the anti-Semitism he was spreading, which was genuinely noxious\nand Ill-considered and has potential knock on effects\nin the Black community. I mean, there's an ambient\nlevel of anti-Semitism in the Black community that\nis worth worrying about and talking about anyway. There's a bunch of guys, you know, playing the knockout game in Brooklyn, just punching Orthodox Jews in the face. And I think letting Kanye\nair his anti-Semitism that publicly only raises the likelihood of that\nrather than diminishes it. - I don't know, so lemme\nsay just a couple things. So one, my belief at\nthe time was it doesn't, it decreases it, showing empathy while\npushing back decreases the likelihood of that. It might, on the surface,\nlook like it's increasing it, but that's simply\nbecause the anti-Semitism or the hatred in general\nis brought to the surface and that people talk about it. But I should also say that\nyou're one of the only people that wrote to me privately criticizing me. And like out of the people\nI really respect and admire. And that was really valuable. That like I had to, painful, 'cause I had to think\nthrough it for a while. - Yeah. - It still haunts me, because the other kind of\ncriticism I got a lot of, people basically said things towards me, based on who I am, that\nthey hate me, just- - You mean anti-Semitic things or that- - Yeah, anti-Semitic things. I just hate the word anti-Semitic. It's like racist. - Well, but here's the reality. So I'm someone, so I'm Jewish, you know, although obviously not religious. I have never taken, you know, I've been a student of\nthe Holocaust, obviously. I know a lot about that and there's reason to be a student of the Holocaust. But in my lifetime and in my experience, I have never taken\nantisemitism very seriously. I have not worried about it. I have not made a thing of it. I've done exactly one podcast on it. You know, I had Berry Wise on my podcast when her book came out. But it really is a thing and it's something we have to\nkeep an eye on societally, because it's a unique\nkind of hatred, right? It's unique in that it seems, it's knit together with, it's\nnot just ordinary racism, it's knit together with\nlots of conspiracy theories that never seem to die out. It can, by turns, equally animate the left and the right politically. I mean, what's so perverse\nabout anti-Semitism, look in the American\ncontext, with the far right, you know, with white supremacists, Jews aren't considered\nwhite, so they hate us in the same spirit in which\nthey hate Black people or brown people or anyone who's not white. But on the left, Jews are\nconsidered extra white. I mean, we're the extra beneficiaries of white privilege, right? And in the Black community,\nthat is often the case, right? We're a minority that has thrived. And it seems to stand as a counterpoint to all of the problems that other minorities suffer,\nin particular, you know, African-Americans in the American context. And, yeah, Asians are now\ngetting a little bit of this, you know, like the model minority issue.",

And there's no guarantee it\ncan't suddenly become much, much uglier than we have any reason to expect it to become,\neven in our society. And so there's kind of a special concern at moments like that where you have an immensely\ninfluential person in a community who already\nhas a checkered history with respect to their own\nbeliefs about the Jews and the conspiracies and all the rest. And he's just messaging, you know, not especially fully opposed by you and anyone else who's given him the microphone at that\nmoment, to the world. And so that, you know, made my Spidey-Sense tingle. - Yeah, it's complicated.\nThe stakes are very high. And I, somebody that's\nbeen obviously family and also reading a lot about World War II, and just this whole period, it was a very difficult conversation. But I believe in the power, especially given who I am of, not always, but sometimes\noften turning the other cheek. - Oh yeah, and again, things change when they're for public\nconsumption, you know, so it's like, I mean, the cut for me that, you know, has just, the use case\nI keep stumbling upon is the kinds of things that I will\nsay on a podcast like this, or if I'm giving a public lecture versus the kinds of things\nI will say at dinner with strangers or with friends. Like if I'm in an elevator with strangers, and I hear someone say something stupid, I don't feel an intellectual\nresponsibility to turn around in the confines of that\nspace with them and say, listen, that thing you\njust said about X, Y or Z is completely false and here's why, right? But if somebody says it in front of me on some public dais where I'm\nactually talking about ideas, that's when, you know, there's a different responsibility\nthat comes online so- - The question is how you\nsay it, how you say it. - Or even whether you say\nanything in those, I mean, there are moments there, there are definitely moments\nto privilege civility or just to pick your battles. I mean, sometimes it's just not worth it to get into it with\nsomebody out in real life. - I just believe in the power of empathy, both in the elevator, and when a bunch of people are listening, that when they see you willing to consider another human being's perspective, it just gives more power\nto your words after. - Well, yeah, but until it doesn't. Like 'cause you can... - Right, there's a balance.\n- You can extend charity too far, right? Like it can be absolutely obvious what someone's motives really are and they're, you know,\ndissembling about that, right? And so then you're taking at face value their representations, begins to look like you're\njust being duped and you're not actually doing the work of putting pressure on\na bad actor, you know? So it's, and again, the mental illness component here makes it very difficult to think about what you should or shouldn't\nhave said to Kanye. - So I think the topic of platforming is pretty interesting. Like what's your view on\nplatforming controversial people? Let's start with the old, would you interview\nHitler on your podcast? And how would you talk to him? Oh, and follow-up question. Would you interview him in 1935, '41, and then like '45? - Well, I think we have\nan uncanny valley problem with respect to this issue of whether or not to speak\nto bad people, right? So if a person's sufficiently bad, right? If they're all the way out of the valley, then you can talk to them and it's just, it's totally unproblematic\nto talk to them, because you don't have to\nspend any time signaling to your audience that you\ndon't agree with them. I mean, if you're interviewing Hitler, you don't have to say, listen, I just gotta say before we start, I don't agree with the whole, you know, genocide thing and, you know,\nI just think you're killing, you know, killing mental\npatients and vans and that was all bad, that's a bad look. So you just, it can go without saying that you don't agree with this person and you're not platforming them to signal boost their views. You're just trying to, if\nthey're sufficiently evil, you can go into it very much\nas an anthropologist would. You just wanna understand\nthe nature of evil, right? You just wanna understand\nthis phenomenon, like,",

Is genocide really happening? - Yeah, yeah.\n- It's 1942, '43- - No, no, no, if you're on the cusp of it where it's just he's someone\nwho's gaining power and you don't wanna help facilitate that, then there's a question of whether you can undermine him while\npushing back against him in that interview, right? So there are people I wouldn't talk to just because I don't\nwanna give them oxygen, and I don't think that in the context of my interviewing them, I'm gonna be able to take the wind out of their sails at all, right? So it's like for whatever, either because, an asymmetric advantage, because I just know that they\ncan do something that they, within the span of an hour, that I can't correct for, you know? It's like they can light many small fires and it just takes too\nmuch time to put them out. - That's more like on\nthe topic of vaccines, for example, having a debate\non the efficacy of vaccines. - Yeah.\n- Okay.. - It's not that I don't think sunlight is usually the best disinfectant.

But still, there are debate's worth having even given that limitation. And they're the right people\nto have those specific debates. And there's certain\ntopics where, you know, I'll debate someone just\nbecause I'm the right person for the job and it doesn't matter how messy they're gonna be, it's just worth it because I can make my points land at least to the right part of the audience. - So some of it is just your own skill and competence and also\ninterest in preparing correctly? - Well, yeah, yeah, in the\nnature of the subject matter and yeah, but there are other\npeople who just, by default, I would say, well, there's no reason to\ngive this guy a platform. And there are also people\nwho are so confabulatory that they're making such\na mess with every sentence that you, insofar as you're even trying to interact with what they're saying, you're, by definition, going to fail, and you're going to seem to fail to a sufficiently large uninformed audience where it's gonna be a net negative for the cause of truth, no matter how good you are. So like, for instance, I think talking to Alex Jones on any topic for any reason\nis probably a bad idea, because I just think he's just neurologically\nwired to just, I mean, utter a string of sentences. He'll get 20 sentences out, each of which has to be, each of which is, you know, contains more lies than the last. And there's not time enough in the world to run down, and certainly not time enough in the span of a conversation to run\ndown each of those leads to bedrock so as to falsify it. I mean, he'll just make shit up or make shit up and then weave it in with, you know, half truths and and micro truths that give some semblance of credibility to somebody out there. I mean, apparently millions\nof people out there. And there's just no way to untangle that in real time with him. I have noticed that you\nhave an allergic reaction to confabulatorization. - [Sam] Yeah, confabulation, yeah. - Confabulation.\n- Yeah, yeah. - That if somebody says\nsomething a little micro untruth, it really stops your brain. - Here I'm not talking\nabout micro untruths, I'm just talking about making\nup things out of whole cloth. Just like if someone says\nsomething like, well, what about, and then the thing they put at the end of that sentence is just a set of pseudo facts, right? That you can't possibly authenticate or not in the span of that\nconversation, they will, you know, whether it's about\nUFOs or anything else, right? They will seem to make you\nlook like an ignoramus, when in fact everything they're\nsaying is specious, right? Whether they know it or not. I mean, there's some\npeople who are just crazy and there's some people who are just bullshitting\nand they're not even tracking whether it's true. It just feels good and there's some people who are consciously lying about things. - But don't you think there's just a kinda jazz masterpiece of untruth that you should\nbe able to just wave off by saying like, well, none of that is backed up by any evidence and just almost like take\nit to the humor place? - Well, yeah.\n- And then... - But the thing is is, I mean, just the place I'm\nfamiliar with doing this and not doing this is",

But that like, it happened\nto be in my wheelhouse, 'cause I had spent so much time\nstudying religion on my own, and I was also very interested in the underlying spiritual\nconcerns of every religion. And so I was, you know, I devoted more than a\nfull decade of my life to just, you know, what is real here? What is possible? What is the nature of subjective reality and how does it relate\nto reality at large? And is there anything to, you know, who was someone like Jesus or Buddha? And are these people frauds or are these just myths or is there really a continuum of insight to be had\nhere that is interesting? So I spent a lot of time on that question through the full decade of my 20s. - [Lex] And that was launched\nin part by 9/11 truth or- - No, but then when 9/11 happened, I had spent all this time, you know, reading religious books, understanding, empathically understanding the motivations of religious people, right? Knowing just how fully\ncertain people believe what they say they believe, right? So I took religious\nconvictions very seriously. And then people started flying\nplants into our buildings and so I knew that there was something to be said about that-\n- Allegedly. - The core doctrines of\nIslam, yeah, exactly. So I went down, so that became my wheelhouse\nfor a time, you know, terrorism and jihadism and related topics. And so the 9/11 truth\nconspiracy thing kept, you know, getting aimed at me. And the question was, well, do I wanna debate these people, right, like.\n- Yeah, Alex Jones, perhaps? - Yeah, I mean, yeah, so Alex Jones, I think\nwas an early purveyor of it, although I don't think I knew\nwho he was at that point. And privately I had some very long debates with people who, you know, one person in my family went\nway down that rabbit hole. And I just, you know,\nevery six months or so, I'd literally write the\ntwo-hour email, you know, and that would try to deprogram him, you know, however ineffectually. And so I went back and forth\nfor years on that topic in private with people, but I could see the\nstructure of the conspiracy. I could see the nature of how impossible it was to play Whac-A-Mole sufficiently well, so as to convince anyone of anything who was not seeing the problematic structure\nof that way of thinking. I mean, it's not actually a thesis. It's a proliferation of anomalies that you can't actually\nconnect all the dots that are being pointed to. They don't connect in a coherent way. They're incompatible thesis that are not, and their incompatibility\nis not being acknowledged. But they're running this algorithm of things are never what they seem. There's always malicious\nconspirators doing things perfectly that we see all, we see evidence of human\nincompetence everywhere else. No one can tie their shoes, you know, expertly anywhere else. But over here, people are perfectly competent, they're perfectly concealing thing, like thousands of people\nare collaborating, you know, inexplicably, I mean,\nincentivized by what, who knows? They're collaborating to murder thousands of their neighbors and no one\nis breathing a peep about it. No one's getting caught on camera. No one's breathed a word of\nit to a journalist and so I've dealt with that style of thinking and I know what it's like to be in the weeds of a conversation like that\nand the person will say, okay, well, but what\ndo you make of the fact that all those F-16s were flown 800 miles out to sea on the morning of 9/11 doing an exercise that hadn't even been scheduled\nfor that day, but it was, and now all of these are, I dimly recall some thesis of that kind, but I'm just making these\nthings up now, right? So like that detail, hadn't even been scheduled for that day, inexplicably run that day. Like so how long would it take\nto track that down, right? The idea that this is anomalous, like that there was a F-16 exercise run and it wasn't even supposed\nto be run that day, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - Someone like Alex Jones,",

I just made up Project Mockingbird. I don't know what it is, but that's the kind of thing\nthat comes tumbling out in a conversation like that. That's the kind of thing, frankly, I was worried about in\nthe COVID conversation, because not that someone like\nBret would do it consciously, but someone like Bret is swimming in a sea of misinformation\non social, living on Twitter, getting people sending the\nblog post and the study from, you know, the Philippines that\nshowed that in this cohort, ivermectin did X, right? And like to actually run\nanything to ground, right? You have to actually do\nthe work journalistically and scientifically and\nrun it to ground, right? So for some of these questions, you actually have to be a\nstatistician to say, okay, they used the wrong statistics\nin this experiment, right? Now, yes, we could take\nall the time to do that, or we could, at every stage along the way, in a context where we have experts we can trust, go with what 97% of the\nexperts are saying about X, about the safety of mRNA, about the transmissibility of COVID, about whether to wear\nmasks or not wear masks. And I completely agree\nthat that broke down unacceptably over the last few years, but I think that's largely, social media and blogs and the efforts of podcasters\nand Substack writers were not just a response to that, I think it was a symptom of\nthat and a cause of that, right? And I think we are living\nin an environment where people, we've basically, we have trained ourselves not to be able to agree about facts on any topic, no matter how urgent, right? What's flying in our sky? You know, what's happening in Ukraine? Is Putin just de-Nazifying Ukraine? I mean, like, there are people who we respect who are spending time down\nthat particular rabbit hole. Like this is, you know, maybe there are\na lot of Nazis in Ukraine, and that's the real problem, right? Maybe Putin's not the\nbad actor here, right? How much time do I have to spend empathizing with Putin to\nthe point of thinking, well, maybe Putin's got a point. And it's like, what about the polonium\nand the nerve agents and the killing of journalists and the, you know, Navalny and\nlike, does that count? Well, no, listen, I'm not paying so much attention to that, because I'm following all\nthese interesting people on Twitter and they're giving\nsome pro-Putin material here. And there are some Nazis in Ukraine. It's not like there are\nno Nazis in Ukraine. How am I gonna weight these things? I think people are being\ndriven crazy by Twitter. - Yeah, but you're kinda\nspeaking to conspiracy theories that pollute everything, but every example you gave is kind of a bad faith style of conversation. - But it's not necessarily\nknowingly bad faith by, I mean, the people who are\nworried about Ukrainian Nazis, I mean, they're some of the same people. They're the same people\nwho are worried about ivermectin got suppressed. Like Ivermectin is really a panacea, but it got suppressed, because no one could make billions on it. It's the same, it's literally, in many cases, the same\npeople and the same efforts to unearth those facts.\n- And you're saying it's very difficult to have conversations with those kinds of people. What about a conversation\nwith Trump himself? Would you do a podcast with Trump? - No, I don't think so. I don't think I'd be\nlearning anything about him. It's like with Hitler, and I'm not comparing\nTrump to Hitler, but- - Clips guy, here's your chance. - Yeah.\n- You got this one. - With certain world historical figures, I would just feel like, okay, this is an opportunity to learn something that I'm not gonna learn. I think Trump is among the\nmost superficial people we have ever laid eyes on, right? Like he is in public view, right?",

And I think, so I think the liability of, so for instance, I think Joe Rogan was very wise not to have\nTrump on his podcast. I think all he would've been doing is he would've put himself in a situation where he couldn't adequately contain the damage Trump was doing and he was just gonna make\nTrump seem cool to a whole new, you know, potentially new cohort of his massive audience, right? I mean, they would've had a lot of laughs. Trump's funny, I mean, the entertainment value of\nthings is so influential. I mean, there was that one\ndebate where Trump, you know, got a massive laugh\non, you know, his line, you know, only Rosie O'Donnell, right? The truth is, we're living in a political\nsystem where if you can get a big laugh during a\npolitical debate, you win. It doesn't matter who you are, right? Like that's the level of, you know, it doesn't matter how uninformed you are, it doesn't matter that\nhalf the debate was about what the hell we should\ndo about, you know, a threat of nuclear war or anything else. It's, we're monkeys, right? And we like to laugh. - Well, 'cause you brought up Joe, he's somebody like you I look up to. I've learned a lot from him, because I think who he is\nprivately as a human being, also he's kind of the\nvoice of curiosity to me. He inspired me that, so\nunending, open-minded curiosity, much like you are the voice of reason. They recently had a podcast, Joe had recently a podcast\nwith Jordan Peterson and brought you up saying\nthey still have hope for you. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Any chance that-\n- Saw that clip. Yeah. - Any chance that you'd talk to Joe again and reinvigorate your friendship? - Yeah, well, I reached\nout to him privately when I saw that clip.\n- Did you use the power of love? - Joe knows I love him and\nconsider him a friend, right? So there's no issue there. He also knows I'll be\nhappy to do his podcast when we get that together,\nyou know, so there's no, I've got no policy of not talking to Joe or not doing his podcast. I mean, I think we got a little sideways along these same lines where, you know, we've talked about Bret\nand Elon and other people. It was never to that\ndegree with Joe because Joe's in a very different lane, right? And consciously so, I mean, Joe is a standup comic who interviews, who just is interested in everything, interviews the widest\nconceivable variety of people and just lets his interests collide with their expertise, sort of, you know, lack of expertise. I mean, he's, again, it's a super wide variety of people. He'll talk about anything, and he can always pull the\nrip cord saying, you know, I don't know what the fuck I'm saying, I'm a comic, I'm stoned. We just drank too much, right? Like it's very entertaining. It's all in, you know, to my eye, it's all in good faith. I think Joe is an extraordinarily\nethical, good person. - Also doesn't use Twitter. Doesn't really use Twitter.\n- Right. Yeah, yeah. No, but the crucial difference though is because he is an entertainer first, I mean, I'm not saying he's not smart and he doesn't understand things. I mean, what's potentially\nconfusing is he's very smart and he's also very informed. His full-time job is, you know, when he is not doing standup or doing color commentary for the UFC, his full-time job is talking\nto lots of very smart people at great length. So he's created, you know, the Joe Rogan University for himself and he's gotten a lot of\ninformation crammed into his head. So it's not that he's\nuninformed, but he can always, when he feels that he's uninformed or when it turns out he\nwas wrong about something, he can always pull the rip chord and say, I'm just a comic. We were stoned. It was fun. You know, don't take\nmedical advice from me. I don't play a doctor\non the internet. Right? I can't quite do that, right? You can't quite do that.\nWe're in different lanes. I'm not saying you and I are\nin exactly the same lane, but for much of Joe's audience, I'm just this establishment shill who's just banging on about, you know, the universities and medical journals and it's not true, but that\nwould be the perception. And as a counterpoint to\na lot of what's being said on Joe's podcast or, you know, certainly Bret's podcast on these topics, I can see how they\nwould form that opinion.",

So there's nothing that Candace Owens has said about wokeness that\nI haven't said about wokeness insofar as she's speaking\nrationally about wokeness. But we have to be able to keep multiple things in view, right? If you could only look at\nthe problem of wokeness and you couldn't acknowledge the problem of Trump and Trumpism and QAnon and the explosion of\nirrationality that was happening on the right and bigotry that\nwas happening on the right, you were just disregarding\nhalf of the landscape and many people took half of the problem. in recent years, The last five years is a story\nof many people taking half of the problem and monetizing\nthat half of the problem and getting captured by an audience that only wanted that half of the problem talked about in that way. And, I mean, this is the larger issue of audience capture,\nwhich, you know, is very, I'm sure it's an ancient problem, but it's a very helpful phrase that I think comes to us courtesy of our mutual friend Eric Weinstein and audience capture's a thing. And I believe I've\nwitnessed many, you know, casualties of it. And if there's anything\nI've been on guard against in my life, you know,\nprofessionally it's been that. And when I noticed that I had\na lot of people in my audience who didn't like my criticizing Trump, I really leaned into it. And when I noticed that\na lot of the other cohort of my audience didn't like\nme criticizing the far left and wokeness, they thought I was, you know, exaggerating that problem. I leaned into it because\nI thought those parts of my audience were absolutely wrong. And I didn't care about\nwhether I was gonna lose those parts of my audience. There are people who\nhave created, you know, knowingly or not, there are people who've\ncreated different incentives for themselves, because\nof how they've monetized their podcast and because\nof the kind of signal they've responded to in their audience. And I worry about, you know, Bret would consider\nthis a totally invidious ad hominem thing to say, but I really do worry that\nthat's happened to Bret. I think I cannot explain\nhow you do a hundred, with all the things in the\nuniverse to be interested in and of all the things he's competent to speak intelligently about, I don't know how you do a hundred podcasts in a row on COVID, right? It's just, it makes no sense. - You thin,k in part, audience\ncapture can explain that? - I absolutely think it can. Yeah. - What about, do you, like, for example, do you feel pressure to not admit that you made a mistake on COVID or made a mistake on Trump? I'm not saying you feel that way, but do you feel this pressure? So you've attacked audience capture within the way you do stuff, so you don't feel as much\npressure from the audience, but within your own ego? - I mean, again, the people who think I'm wrong about any of these topics are gonna think, okay, you're just not admitting\nthat you're wrong. But then now we're having a\ndispute about specific facts. There are things that\nI believed about COVID or worried might be true\nabout COVID two years ago that I no longer believe or\nI'm not so worried about now and vice versa. I mean, like things have flipped, certain things have flipped upside down. The question is, was I wrong? So here's the cartoon version of it, but this is something I\nsaid probably 18 months ago, and it's still true. You know, when I saw what\nBret was doing on COVID, you know, let's call it two years ago, I said, even if he is right, even if it turns out that\nivermectin is a panacea and the mRNA vaccines kill\nmillions of people, right? He's still wrong right now. His reasoning is still flawed right now. His facts still suck right now, right? And his confidence is, is unjustified now. That was true then, that will\nalways be true then, right? And so, and not much has changed for me to revisit any of my time points along the way. Again, I will totally concede that if I had teenage boys and their schools were demanding that they be vaccinated\nwith the mRNA vaccine,",

Just take the shot, you idiots. I view that largely, as a result, a panicked response to the\nmisinformation explosion that happened and the public, the populist resistance\nanimated by misinformation that just made it impossible to get anyone to cooperate, right? So it was just, part of it is, again, a pendulum swing in the wrong direction, somewhat analogous to the\nwoke response to Trump and the Trumpist response to woke, right? So a lot of people have\njust gotten pushed around for bad reasons, but\nunderstandable reasons, but yes, there are caveats to, things have changed\nabout my view of COVID, but the question is if you\nroll back the clock 18 months, was I wrong to want to platform Eric Topol, you know, a very well-respected\ncardiologist, on this topic, or, you know, Nicholas Christakis to talk about the network effects of, you know, whether we should\nclose schools, right? He had written a book on COVID. His, you know, network\neffects or his wheelhouse, both as an MD and as a sociologist. There was a lot that we believed\nwe knew about the efficacy of closing schools\nduring pandemics, right? You know, during the Spanish\nflu pandemic and others, right? But there's a lot we\ndidn't know about COVID. We didn't know, we didn't know how negligible the effects\nwould be on kids compared to older people. We didn't know, like the- - So my problem, I really enjoyed your\nconversation with Eric Topol, but also didn't. So he's one of the great\ncommunicators, in many ways, on Twitter, like distillation\nof the current data. But he, I hope I'm not overstating it, but there is a bit of an arrogance from him that I think could be explained\nby him being exhausted, by being constantly attacked\nby conspiracy theory, like anti-vaxxers.\n- Yeah. - To me, the same thing\nhappens with people that start drifting to be being right wing, is to get attacked so much by the left, they become almost irrational\nand arrogant in their beliefs. And I felt your\nconversation with Eric Topol did not sufficiently empathize with people that have skepticism, but also did not sufficiently communicate uncertainty we have. So like many of the decisions you made, many of the things you were talking about were kind of saying there's\na lot of uncertainty, but this is the best\nthing we could do now. - Well, it was a forced choice. You're gonna get COVID, do you wanna be vaccinated\nwhen you get it? That was always, in my view, an easy choice. And it's up until you start breaking apart the\ncohorts and you start saying, okay, wait a minute, there\nis this myocarditis issue in young men. Let's talk about that. Before that story emerged, it was just clear that this is, if it's not knocking down transmission as much as we had hoped, it is still mitigating\nsevere illness and death. And I still believe that it is the current view of most people competent to analyze the data, that we lost something like\n300,000 people unnecessarily in the US because of a vaccine hesitancy. - But I think there's a way to communicate with humility about the uncertainty of things that would increase the vaccination rate. - I do believe that it is rational and sometimes effective to signal impatience with certain bad ideas, right? And certain conspiracy theories and certain forms of misinformation. - You think so? - 'Cause it's just- - I just think it makes you look like a douche bag most times. - Well, I mean, certain\npeople are persuadable, certain people are not\npersuadable, but it's... No, 'cause there's not enough,\nit's the opportunity cost. Not everything can be given a patient hearing.

I know these mRNA vaccines are safe. I know exactly how to run a lockdown. No, this is a situation where\nyou want the actual pilots to fly the plane, right? We needed experts who we could trust. And insofar as our experts got captured by all manner of things, I mean, some of them got captured by Trump. Some of them were made to look ridiculous just standing next to Trump while he was bloviating about, you know, whatever that, you know,\nit's just gonna go away. There's just 15 people, you know, there's 15 people in a cruise ship and it's just gonna go away. There's gonna be no problem.

Still is a disaster. But it doesn't mean that, I mean, but the thing is, there's a big difference between\nme and Bret in this case. I didn't do a hundred podcasts on COVID. I did like two podcasts on COVID. The measure of my concern\nabout COVID can be measured in how many podcasts I did on it, right? It's like once we had a sense\nof how to live with COVID, I was just living with COVID, right? Like, okay, you get vaxxed\nor don't get vaxxed? Wear a mask or don't wear a\nmask, travel or don't travel? like you've got a few things to decide, but my kids were stuck at\nhome on iPads, you know, for too long. I didn't agree with that. You know, it was obviously not functional. Like I criticized that on the margins, but there was not much to do about it, but the thing I didn't do is make this my life and just browbeat people\nwith one message or another. We need a public health regime where we can trust what\nconfident people are saying to us about, you know, what medicines are safe to take. And in the absence of\nthat, craziness is gonna, even in the presence of that, craziness is gonna proliferate, given the tools we've built. But in the absence of that, it's gonna proliferate for\nunderstandable reasons. And that's gonna, it's not gonna be good\nnext time when something, orders of magnitude\nmore dangerous hits us. And that's, I spent a, you know, insofar as I think about this issue, I think much more about\nnext time than this time. - Before this COVID thing, you and Bret had some good conversations. I would say we're friends. What do you admire most about Bret outside of all the criticism we've\nhad about this COVID topic? - Well, I think Bret\nis very smart and he's a very ethical person who wants good things for the world. I mean, I have no reason to doubt that. So the fact that we're on, you know, we're crosswise on this issue does not mean that I\nthink he's a bad person. I mean, the thing that worried\nme about what he was doing, and this was true of Joe,\nand this was true of Elon, this was the true of many other people, is that once you're messaging\nat scale to a vast audience, you incur a certain kind\nof responsibility not to get people killed. And I did worry that, yeah, people were making\ndecisions on the basis of the information that\nwas getting shared there. And that's why I was, I think, fairly circumspect. I just said, okay, give me the center of the fairway expert\nopinion at this time point and at this time point\nand at this time point, and then I'm out, right? I don't have any more to say about this. I'm not an expert on COVID. I'm not an expert on the\nsafety of mRNA vaccines. If something changes, so is to become newsworthy,\nthen maybe I'll do a podcast, so I just did a podcast on the lab leak. - Right, the lab leak.\n- Right?

And then we had to figure\nout how to vaccinate and to mitigate and to develop\ntreatments, and all of that. So the origin story didn't matter. Generically speaking, either origin story was politically inflammatory and made the Chinese look bad, right? And the Chinese response\nto this looks bad, whatever the origin story, right? They're not cooperating. They're stopping their domestic flights, but letting their\ninternational flights go. I mean, it's just, they were bad actors and\nthey should be treated as such regardless of the origin, right? And, you know, I would argue that the wet market origin is even more politically invidious\nthan the lab leak origin. I mean-\n- Why do you think? - Because the lab leak, to my eye, the lab leak could\nhappen to anyone, right? All these advanced countries are running these dangerous labs. That's a practice that we\nshould be worried about, you know, in general. We know lab leaks are a problem. There have been multiple lab\nleaks of even worse things that haven't gotten out\nof hand in this way, but, you know, worse pathogens. We're wise to be worried about this. And on some level, it could\nhappen to anyone, right? The wet market makes them\nlook like barbarians, live in another century. Like you gotta clean up those wet markets. Like what are you doing putting a bat on top of a pangolin on\ntop of a duck on top. It's like, get your shit together. So like if anything, the wet\nmarket makes them look worse, in my view. Now I'm sure there's, I'm sure that what they actually\ndid to conceal a lab leak, if it was a lab leak, I mean, all of that is gonna look odious. - Do you think we'll ever\nget to the bottom of that? I mean, one of the big negative, I would say, failures of\nAnthony Fauci, and so on, is to be transparent and clear, and it's just a good communicator about gain of function research, the dangers of that, the\nsuccess, like the, you know, why it's a useful way of research, but it's also dangerous. - [Sam] Right. - You know, just being\ntransparent about that as opposed to just\ncoming off really shady. Of course the conspiracy theorists and the politicians are not helping, but this just created a giant mess. - Yeah, no, I would agree. So that exchange with Fauci\nand Rand Paul that went viral, yeah, I would agree that\nFauci looked like he was taking refuge in kind of\nvery lawyered language and not giving a straightforward account of what we do and why we do it. And so, yeah, I think it looked shady. It played shady and it probably was shady. I mean, I don't know how\npersonally entangled he is with any of this, but yeah, the gain of function\nresearch is something that I think we're wise to be worried about. And in so far as I judge myself adequate to have an opinion on this, I think it should be banned, right? Like probably a podcast I'll do, you know, if you or\nsomebody else doesn't do it in the meantime, you know, I would like a virologist on to defend it against a virologist who would criticize it. Forget about just the\ngain of function research. I don't even understand\nvirus hunting at this point. It's like, I don't know. I don't even know why you\nneed to go into a cave to find this next virus\nthat could be circulating among bats that may\njump zoonotically to us. Why do that when we can make, when we can sequence in\na day and make vaccines in a weekend? I mean like what kind of head start do you think you're getting? - That's the surprising new thing, how quickly we can develop a vaccine. - [Sam] Exactly.",

                "text": "But the shadiness around lab leak. - I think the point I didn't\nmake about Bret's style of engaging this issue is\npeople are using the fact that he was early on lab leak to suggest that he was\nright about ivermectin and about mRNA vaccines and all the rest. Like, no, none of that connects and it was possible to\nbe falsely confident, like you shouldn't have\nbeen confident about lab, no one should have been\nconfident about lab leak early, even if it turns out\nto be lab leak, right? It was always plausible. It was never definite,\nit still isn't definite. Zoonotic is also quite plausible. It certainly was super plausible then. Both are politically uncomfortable. Both at the time were inflammatory to be banging on about when we were trying to secure some kind of cooperation\nfrom the Chinese, right? So there's a time for these things and it's possible to be\nright by accident, right? You're reasoning, the\nstyle of reasoning matters whether you're right or not, you know? It's like, because your style of reasoning is dictating what you're\ngonna do on the next topic. - Sure, but this is, this multi-variate situation here, it's really difficult to\nknow what's right on COVID, given all the uncertainty, all the chaos, especially when you step\noutside the pure biology, virology of it and you\nstart getting into policy. - [Sam] Hmm. - It's really-\n- Yeah. It's just trade-offs. Yeah. - Like transmissibility of the virus. Sure, just knowing if 65% of the population gets vaccinated, what effect would that have? Just even knowing those things, just modeling all those things. Given all the other incentives. I mean, Pfizer. I dunno what to think\n- But you had the CEO of Pfizer on your podcast. Did you leave that\nconversation feeling like this is a person who is consciously reaping windfall profits on a dangerous vaccine and putting everyone at intolerable risk or did you think this person was making a good faith\nattempt to save lives and had no taint of bad incentives\nor something between. - The thing I sensed, and I felt in part, it was a failure on my part, but I sensed that I was\ntalking to a politician. So it's not thinking of\nthere was malevolence there or benevolence, there was... - He just had a job. - He put on a suit and\nI was talking to a suit, not a human being. Now he said that his son was\na big fan of the podcast, which is why he wanted to do it. So I thought I would be\ntalking to a human being. And I asked challenging questions, but I thought the\ninternet thinks otherwise. Every single question in that interview was a challenging one,\nbut it wasn't grilling, which is what people seem to want to do with pharmaceutical companies. There's a deep distrust with\npharmaceutical companies. - But what's the alternative? I mean, I totally get-\n- Right. - That windfall profits, at a time of, you know, a public health\nemergency looks bad. It is a bad look, right? But how do we reward and return capital to risk takers who will spend a billion\ndollars to design a new drug for a disease that maybe only harms, you know, a single digit percentage\nof the population. It's like, well, what\ndo we wanna encourage? And who do we want to get rich? I mean, so like the\nperson who cures cancer, do we want that person to get rich or not? We want the person who gave\nus the iPhone to get rich, but we don't want the person who cures cancer to get rich? I mean, what are we trying to do- - I think it's a very gray area. So what we want is the person who declares that they have a cure for cancer to have authenticity and transparency. Like I think we're good now, as a population, smelling bullshit. And there is something about the Pfizer CEO, for example, just CEOs of pharmaceutical\ncompanies in general, just because they're so lawyered up, so much marketing, PR people, that they are, you just smell bullshit. You're not talking to real human, that it just feels like none of it is transparent to us as a public. So like this whole talking point that Pfizer's only\ninterested in helping people just doesn't ring true, even though it very well could be true.",

What's happening underneath this? - [Sam] Right. - There's certain kinds of\ncommunication styles that seem to be more, serve as better catalysts\nfor conspiracy theories. And I'm not sure what that is, because I don't think there's\nan alternative for capitalism in delivering drugs that help people. But also at the same time, there seems to need to\nbe a more transparency and plus like regulation that\nactually makes sense versus it seems like pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to corruption. - Yeah, I worry about all that, but I also do think that most of the people going into those fields, and most of the people\ngoing into government- - They wanna do good.\n- Are doing it for a good, they're non-psychopaths\ntrying to get good things done and trying to solve hard problems. And they're not trying to get rich. I mean, many of the people are, it's like, I mean, bad incentives\nare something, again, I've uttered that phrase\n30 times on this podcast, but it's just, almost everywhere it\nexplains normal people creating terrible harm, right? It's not that there are that\nmany bad people, you know? And, yes, it makes the truly bad people that much more remarkable and worth paying attention to. But the bad incentives and the power of bad ideas do much more harm. Because, I mean, that's what gets good people\nrunning in the wrong direction or doing things that are clearly creating\nunnecessary suffering. - You've had, and I hope still have a friendship with Elon Musk, especially over the topic of AI. You have a lot of interesting\nideas that you both share, concerns that you both share. Well, let me first ask, what\ndo you admire most about Elon? - Well, you know, I had\na lot of fun with Elon. I like Elon a lot. I mean, Elon, I knew as\na friend, I like a lot. And, you know, it's not gonna surprise anyone. I mean, he's done and he's\ncontinuing to do amazing things. And I think he's, you know, I think if many of\nhis aspirations are realized, the world would be a much better place. I think it's just, it's amazing to see what he's built and what he's attempted to\nbuild and what he may yet build. - So with Tesla, with SpaceX, with- - Yeah, no, I'm a fan\nof almost all of that. I mean, there are\nwrinkles to a lot of that, you know, or some of that. - All humans are full of wrinkles. - There's something very Trumpian about how he's acting on Twitter, right? I mean, Twitter, I think Twitter's, he thinks Twitter is great. He bought the place because\nhe thinks it's so great. I think Twitter's\ndriving him crazy, right? I think he's needlessly\ncomplicating his life and harming his reputation\nand creating a lot of noise and harming a lot of other people. I mean, so like, the thing that I objected\nto with him on Twitter is not that he bought it\nand made changes to it. I mean, that was not, again, I remain agnostic as to whether or not he can improve the platform. It was how he was personally\nbehaving on Twitter, not just toward me, but toward the world. I think when you, you know, forward an article about\nNancy Pelosi's husband being attacked, not as\nhe was by some lunatic, but that it's just some\ngay tryst gone awry, right? That's not what it seems and you link to a website that previously claimed that Hillary Clinton was dead and that a body double was\ncampaigning in her place, that thing was exploding in Trumpistan as a conspiracy theory, right? And it was having its effect, and it matters that he\nwas signal boosting it in front of 130 million people. And so it is with saying that your, you know, your former employee, Yoel Roth is a pedophile, right? I mean, it's like that\nhas real consequences. It appeared to be complete bullshit. And now this guy's getting inundated with death threats, right? And Elon, all that's\ntotally predictable, right? And so he's behaving quite recklessly and there's a long list\nof things like that that he's done on Twitter. It's not ethical. It's not good for him. It's not good for the\nworld. It's not serious. It's just, it's a very\nadolescent relationship to real problems in our society.",

Should I publicly worry about\nWorld War III or not, right? He's doing this shit on Twitter, right? And at the same moment, he's doing these other very impulsive ill-considered things, and he's not showing any willingness to really clean up the mess he makes. He brings Kanye on knowing\nhe's an anti-Semite who's got mental health problems and then kicks him off for a swastika, which I probably wouldn't\nhave kicked him off for a swastika. It's like that's even, like can you really kick\npeople off for swastikas? Is that something that you get banned for? I mean, are you a free speech absolutist if you can't let a swastika show up? I'm not even sure that's an enforceable terms of service, right? There are moments to use swastikas that are not conveying\nhate and not raising the risk of violence. - Clip that. - Yeah, but so much of what he's doing, given that he's, again, scale matters. He's doing this in front\nof 130 million people, that's very different\nthan a million people. And that's very different\nthan 100,000 people. And so when I went off\nthe tracks with Elon, he was doing this about COVID and again, this was a situation where I tried to privately mitigate a friend's behavior and it didn't work out very well. - Did you try to correct him sort of highlighting things he might be wrong on? - Yeah.\n- Or did you use the Lex power of love method? I should write like a pamphlet for Sam Harris to follow.\n- Well, no, but it was totally coming\nfrom a place of love, because I was concerned\nabout his reputation. I was concerned about what he, I mean, there was a twofold concern. I could see what was\nhappening with the tweet. I mean, he'd had this\noriginal tweet that was, I think it was panic over COVID is dumb, or something like that, right? This is in March. This is early March, 2020. - Oh, super early days.\n- Super early. When nobody knew anything, but we saw what was\nhappening in Italy, right? It was totally kicking off. - God, that was a wild time. That's when the toilet paper. - It was totally wild. But that became the most influential tweet on Twitter for that week. I mean, it had more engagement\nthan any other tweet, more than any crazy\nthing Trump was tweeting. I mean, it went off, again, it was just a nuclear bomb of information. And I could see that people\nwere responding to it. Like wait a minute, okay, here's this genius technologist who must have inside information\nabout everything, right? Surely he knows something that is not on the surface about this pandemic. And they were reading into it a lot of information that\nI knew wasn't there, right? And at the time, I didn't think he had any\nreason to be suggesting that. I think he was just\nfiring off a tweet, right? So I reached out to him\nin private, and, I mean, because it was a private\ntext conversation, I won't talk about the details, but I'm just saying\nthat's a case, you know, among the many cases of friends\nwho have public platforms and who did something that\nI thought was dangerous and ill-considered. This was a case where I\nreached out in private and tried to help, genuinely help because it was just, I thought it was harmful in every sense, because it was being misinterpreted. And it was like, oh, okay, you can say that panic over\nanything is dumb, fine, But this was not how this was landing. This was like non-issue, conspiracy, there's gonna be no covid in the US. It's gonna peter out. It's just gonna become a cold. I mean, that's how this\nwas getting received. Whereas at that moment, it was absolutely obvious how\nbig a deal this was gonna be or that it was gonna, at minimum, going to be a big deal. - I don't know if it was obvious, but it was obvious there was a significant probability\nthat it could be a big deal. I remember in March, it\nwas unclear like how big, 'cause there was still stories of it. Like it's probably going to like, the big concern, the\nhospitals might overfill, but it's gonna die out in\nlike two months or something. - Yeah, we did, no, but there was no way we\nweren't going to have tens of thousands of deaths at\na minimum at that point. And it was every, it was totally rational to be worried about hundreds of thousands. And when Nicholas Christakis\ncame on my podcast very early, you know, he predicted quite confidently that we would have about\na million people dead in the US, right? And that didn't seem, you know, it was, you know, I think appropriately hedged,\nbut, I mean, it was still, it was just like, okay, it's just gonna, we're just kind of riding\nthis exponential and",

And then we had a fairly long and detailed exchange on this issue and so that intervention didn't work. And it was not done, you\nknow, I was not an asshole. I was not, I was just\nconcerned, you know, for him, for the world, and, you know. And then there are other\nrelationships where I didn't take the, again, that's an example where taking\nthe time didn't work, right?

And there's a lot of that and, again, I'm not comfortable with\nhow this is all netted out, because I don't know if, you know, you know, frankly, I'm not\ncomfortable with how much time in this conversation\nwe've spent talking about these specific people, like, what good is it for me to talk about Elon or Bret or any of- - I think there's a lot of good, because those friendships,\nlisten, as a fan, these are the conversations I loved, love as a fan. And it feels like COVID\nhas robbed the world of these conversations, because you were exchanging\nback and forth on Twitter, but that's not what I\nmean by conversations. Like long form discussions,\nlike a debate about COVID, like a normal debate. - But there is no, Elon and I shouldn't be debating COVID. - You should be. Here's the thing, with humility, like basically saying\nwe don't really know, like the Rogan method, we're\njust a bunch of idiots. Like one is an engineer, you're\na neuroscientist, but like, and just kind of, okay, here's the evidence and\nbe like normal people. That's what everybody was doing. The whole world was like trying\nto figure out what the hell? - Yeah, but the issue was that at that, so at the moment I had\nthis collision with Elon, certain things were not debatable, right? It was just, it was absolutely clear\nwhere this was going. It wasn't clear how far it was gonna go or how quickly we would mitigate it, but it was absolutely\nclear that it was gonna be an issue, right? The train had come off\nthe tracks in Italy, we knew we weren't gonna seal our borders. There were already people, you know, there ARE already cases known\nto many of us personally in the US at that point. And he was operating by a very different logic that I couldn't engage with. - Sure, but that logic represents\na part of the population, and there's a lot of\ninteresting topics that have a lot of uncertainty around them, like the effectiveness of masks, like- - Yeah, but no, but\nwhere things broke down was not at the point of, oh, there's a lot to talk\nabout, a lot to debate. This is all very interesting. And who knows what's what. It broke down very early at, this is, you know, there's nothing to talk about here. Like either there's a\nwater bottle on the table or there isn't, right, like. - Well, technically there's only 1/4 of a water bottle.\n- Right, yep. - So what defines a water bottle? Is it the water inside the water bottle or is it the water bottle? What I'm giving you is an example of it's worth a conversation. - This is difficult, because this is, we had an exchange in private and I wanna- - [Lex] Sure, sure, sure. - I wanna honor not exposing the details of it, but, you know, the details convinced me that there was not a\nfollow-up conversation on that topic.\n- On this topic. - Yeah.\n- That said, I hope, and I hope to be part\nof helping that happen, that the friendship is rekindled, because one of the topics\nI care a lot about, artificial intelligence,\nyou've had great public and private conversations\nabout this topic and- - Yeah, and Elon was very formative in my taking that issue seriously. I mean, he and I went to\nthat initial conference in Puerto Rico together and it was only because he was going and I found out about it through him, and I just rode his coattails to it, you know, that I got dropped\nin that side of the pool to hear about these\nconcerns at that point. - It would be interesting to hear how's your concern evolved with the coming out of ChatGPT and these new large language models that are fine-tuned with\nreinforcement learning",

One, how has your concern in terms of AGI and super intelligence evolved and how impressed are you with ChatGPT as a student of the human\nmind and mind in general? - Well, my concern about AGI is unchanged. And so I did a, I've spoken about it\na bunch on my podcast, but, you know, I did a TED Talk in 2016, which was the kinda summary of what that conference and, you know, various conversations\nI had after that did to my brain on this topic. - Basically that once super\nintelligence is achieved, there's a takeoff, it becomes exponentially\nsmarter and in a matter of time, they're just, we're ants and they're gods. - Well, yeah, and unless we find some way of permanently tethering a super intelligent self-improving\nAI to our value system. And, you know, I don't believe anyone has\nfigured out how to do that or whether that's even\npossible in principle. I mean, I know people like Stuart Russell who I just had on my podcast, are- - Oh, really? Have you released it yet? - I Haven't released it yet.\n- Oh, great. - He's been on a previous podcast, but we just recorded this week. - 'Cause you haven't done\nan AI podcast in a while, so it's great.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\n- It's great. He's a good person to\ntalk about alignment with. - Yeah, so Stuart I mean,\nStuart has been, you know, probably more than anyone,\nmy guru on this topic. I mean, like just reading\nhis book and doing, I think I've done two podcasts\nwith him at this point. - I think It's called\n\"The Control Problem\" or something like that? - His book is \"Human Compatible.\" - Human Compatible.\n- Yeah, he talks about the control problem. And yeah, so I just think the idea that we can\ndefine a value function in advance that permanently tethers a self-improving, super-intelligent AI to our values as we continue to\ndiscover them, refine them, extrapolate them in an open-ended way, I think that's a tall order. And I think there are many more ways, there must be many more ways\nof designing super intelligence that is not aligned in that way and is not ever approximating\nour values in that way. So, I mean, Stuart's idea, to\nput it in a very simple way, is that he thinks you don't wanna specify the value function upfront. You don't wanna imagine you\ncould ever write the code in such a way as to admit of no loophole. You want to make the AI uncertain as to what human values are and perpetually uncertain\nand always trying to ameliorate that uncertainty by hewing more and more closely to what our professed values are. So like, just it's always\ninterested in us saying, oh, no, no, that's not what we want. That's not what we intend. Stop doing that, right? Like no matter how smart it gets, all it wants to do is more perfectly\napproximate human values. I think there are a lot of\nproblems with that, you know, at a high level, I'm not\na computer scientist, so I'm sure there are many\nproblems at a low level that I don't understand or. - Like how to force a\nhuman into the loop always no matter what. - There's that and like\nwhat humans get a vote and just what is, you know, what do humans value and what\nis the difference between what we say we value and our\nrevealed preferences, which, I mean, if you just, if you were a super intelligent AI that could look at humanity now, I think you could be\nforgiven for concluding that what we value is\ndriving ourselves crazy with Twitter and living\nperpetually on the brink of nuclear war and, you know, just watching, you know, hot girls in yoga pants on TikTok again and again and again, it's like, what- - And you're saying that is not what we- - This is all revealed preference and it's what is an AI to make of that, right? And what should it optimize? Like, so part of, this is also Stuart's observation that one of the insidious things\nabout like the YouTube algorithm is that it's not that it just\ncaters to our preferences, it actually begins to change us in ways so as to make us more predictable. Like it finds ways to\nmake us a better reporter of our preferences and to trim our preferences down so that it can further train to that signal. So the main concern is that most of the people in the field seem not to be taking\nintelligence seriously, like. - Still?\n- Yeah, as they design more and\nmore intelligent machines, and as they profess to\nwant to design true AGI, they're not, again,",

Or they're saying very, you know, pollyannish things like, you know, an AI would never form a motive to harm human, like why\nwould it ever form a motive to be malicious toward humanity, right? Unless we put that motive in there, right? And that's not the concern. The concern is that in the presence of, of vast disparities in competence and in, certainly in a condition where the machines are improving themselves, they're improving their own code, they could be developing\ngoal instrumental goals that are antithetical to our wellbeing without any intent to harm us, right? It's analogous to what we do to every other species on Earth. I mean you and I don't\nconsciously form the intention to harm insects on a daily basis, but there are many things we\ncould intend to do that would in fact, harm insects, because, you know, you decide to repave your driveway or whatever you're doing,\nlike you're just not taking the interest of insects into account, because they're so far beneath you in terms of your cognitive horizons. And so the real challenge here is that if you believe that\nintelligence, you know, scales up on a continuum toward heights that we can only dimly imagine, and I think there's every\nreason to believe that, there's just no reason to\nbelieve that we're near the summit of intelligence. And you can, you know, define, maybe there's some forms of intelligence for which this is not true, but for many relevant forms, you know, like the top 100 things\nwe care about cognitively, I think there's every reason to believe that many of those things, most of those things are\na lot like chess or Go where once the machines\nget better than we are, they're gonna stay better than we are. Although they're, I dunno if you caught the recent thing with Go where, ' this actually came outta Stuart's lab. - One.\n- Yeah, yeah, - Yeah, one time a human beat a machine. - Yeah, they found a hack for that. But anyway, ultimately, there's gonna be no looking back and then the question is what do we do in relationship to these systems that are\nmore competent than we are in every relevant respect? Because it will be a relationship. It's not like, the people who think we're\njust gonna figure this all out, you know, without thinking\nabout it in advance, the solutions are just\ngonna find themselves, seem not to be taking the prospect of really creating autonomous\nsuper intelligence seriously. Like what does that mean? It's every bit as independent and ungovernable ultimately as us having created, I mean, just imagine if we\ncreated a race of people that were 10 times smarter than all of us. Like how would we live with those people? They're 10 times smarter than us, right? Like they begin to talk about\nthings we don't understand. They begin to want things\nwe don't understand. They begin to view us as\nobstacles to them that, so they're solving those problems or gratifying those desires. We become the chickens or the\nmonkeys in their presence. And I think that it's, but for some amazing solution of the sort that Stuart is imagining that we could somehow anchor their reward function permanently, no matter how intelligent scales. I think it's really worth\nworrying about this. I do buy the, you know, the sci-fi notion that\nthis is an existential risk if we don't do it well. - I worry that we don't notice it. I'm deeply impressed with ChatGPT and I'm worried that it will\nbecome super intelligent. These language models would\nbecome super intelligent, because they're basically trained in the collective intelligence\nof the human species. And then it'll start\ncontrolling our behavior if they're integrated into our algorithms, the recommender systems, and then we just won't notice that there's a super intelligent system\nthat's controlling our behavior. - Well, I think that's true even before, far before super-intelligence, even before general intelligence. I mean I think just\nthe narrow intelligence of these algorithms and of what something like, you know, Chat GPT can do,",

Just just the unintended consequences of using it in the ways we are going to be incentivized to\nuse it and, you know, the money to be made\nfrom scaling this thing and what it does to our information space and our sense of just being able to get the ground truth on any facts, it's, yeah, it's super scary. And it was, it's... - Do you think it's a giant\nleap in terms of the development towards AGI, ChatGPT, or we still, is this just an impressive little toolbox? So like when do you think\nthe singularity's coming or is it to you, doesn't\nmatter if eventually- - Yeah, I have no intuitions on that front apart from the fact that if\nwe continue to make progress, it will come, right? So you just have to assume\nwe continue to make progress. There's only two assumptions. You have to assume substrate independence. So there's no reason why\nthis can't be done in silico. It's just we can build\narbitrarily intelligent machines. There's nothing magical\nabout having this done in the wetware of our own brains. I think that is true, and\nI think that's, you know, scientifically parsimonious\nto think that that's true. And then you just have to assume we're gonna\nkeep making progress. It doesn't have to be any\nspecial rate of progress. It doesn't have to be Moore's Law. It can just be, we just keep going. At a certain point we're\ngonna be in relationship to minds, leaving consciousness aside, I don't have any reason to believe that they'll necessarily be conscious by virtue of being super intelligent. And that's its own\ninteresting ethical question. But leaving consciousness aside, they're gonna be more\ncompetent than we are. And then that's like, you know, the aliens\nhave landed, you know? That's literally, that's\nan encounter with, again, leaving aside the possibility that something like Stuart's path is actually available to us, but it is hard to picture, if what we mean by intelligence, all things considered,\nand it's truly general, if that scales and, you know, begins to build upon itself, how you maintain that perfect slavish devotion until the end of time in those systems. - The tether to humans\n- Yeah. - I think my gut says\nthat that tether is not, there's a lot of ways to do it. So it's not this increasingly\nimpossible problem. - Right, so I have no, you know, as you know, I'm not a computer scientist, so I have no intuitions about, just algorithmically, how\nyou would approach that and what's somewhat possible. - My main intuition is\nmaybe deeply flawed, but the main intuition is\nbased on the fact that most of the learning is currently\nhappening on human knowledge. So even ChatGPT is just\ntrained on human data. - [Sam] Right. - I don't see where the takeoff happens where you completely\ngo above human wisdom. The current impressive\naspect of ChatGPT is that it's using collective\nintelligence of all of us. - Well, from what I gleaned, again, from people who know much\nmore about this than I do, I think we have reason to be skeptical that these techniques of, you know, deep learning are actually\ngoing to be sufficient to push us into AGI, right? So it's just, they're not generalizing\nin the way they need to, they're certainly not\nlearning like human children. And so there's brittle and strange ways. It's not to say that the\nhuman path is the only path, you know, and maybe there's, we might learn better lessons by ignoring the way brains work, but we know that they don't generalize and use abstraction the way we do and so. - Although the interesting-\n- They strange holes in their competence. - But the size of the holes\nis shrinking every time and that's, so the intuition\nstarts to slowly fall apart. You know, the intuition is like, surely can't be this simple\nto achieve super intelligence. - [Sam] Yeah, yeah. - (chuckle) But it's\nbecoming simpler and simpler, so I don't know. The progress is quite incredible. I've been extremely impressed with ChatGPT and the new models, and there's a lot of financial\nincentive to make progress in this regard so",

                "text": "some very interesting times. In raising a question that I'm\ngoing to be talking to you, a lot of people brought up this topic, probably because Eric Weinstein\ntalked to Joe Rogan recently and said that he and you were\ncontacted by folks about UFOs. Can you clarify the\nnature of this contact? Can you-\n- Yeah, yeah. - That you were contacted-\n- Well, I mean, I've got very little to say on this. I mean, he has much more to say. I think he went down\nthis rabbit hole further than I did, which\nwouldn't surprise anyone. He's gotten much more of a taste for this sort of thing than I do, but I think we were\ncontacted by the same person. It wasn't clear to me who this person was or how this person got\nmy cell phone number. It didn't seem like we\nwere getting Punked. I mean, the person seemed credible to me. - And they were talking to you about the release of different videos on UFOs? - Yeah, and this was when there was a flurry of activity around this, so there was like a, there was a big New\nYorker article on UFOs, and there was rumors of\ncongressional hearings, I think, coming and there were the videos that were\nbeing debunked or not. And so this person contacted both of us, I think around the same time. And I think he might've\ncontacted Rogan or other, Eric is just the only person\nI've spoken to about it, I think, who I know was contacted and what happened is the\nperson kept, you know, writing a check that he didn't cash. Like he kept saying, \"Okay,\nnext week I'm gonna, you know, I understand this is sounding\nspooky and, you know, you have no reason to really trust me, but next week I'm gonna put you on a\nZoom call with people who you will recognize and\nthey're gonna be, you know, former heads of the CIA and, you know, people who just, you're gonna, within five seconds\nof being on the Zoom call, you'll know this is not a hoax.\" And I said, \"Great, just let me know. Just send me the Zoom link, right?\" And I went, that happened\nmaybe three times, you know, but there was just one phone conversation and then it was just texts, you know, it was just a bunch of texts. And I think Eric spent more time with this person, and I haven't spoken to him about it. I know he spoke about it publicly but. So, you know, it's not that my bullshit\ndetector ever really went off in a big way. It's just the thing never happened and so I lost interest. - So you've made a comment,\nwhich is interesting, that you ran the, which I really appreciate, that you ran a thought\nexperiment of saying, okay, maybe we do have alien spacecraft, or just a thought experiment\nthat aliens did visit. - Yeah.\n- And then this very kind of nihilistic sad thought that it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't affect your life. Can you explain that? - Well, no, I was, I think\nmany people noticed this. I mean, this was a sign of\nhow crazy the news cycle was at that point, right? Like we had COVID, and we had Trump, and I forget when the UFO\nthing was really kicking off. But it just seemed like\nno one had the bandwidth to even be interested in this. It's like I was amazed to notice in myself that I wasn't more\ninterested in figuring out what was going on. It's like, and I considered,\nokay, wait a minute. If this is true, this is the biggest story\nin anyone's lifetime. I mean, contact with alien intelligence is by definition the biggest\nstory in anyone's lifetime, in human history. Why isn't this just totally captivating? And not only was it not\ntotally captivating, it would just barely\nrise into the level of my being able to pay attention to it. And I view that, I mean, one, as, to some degree, an understandable\ndefense mechanism against the bogus claims that have been made about this\nkind of thing in the past. You know, the general sense\nthat it's probably bullshit or it probably has some\nexplanation that is, you know, purely terrestrial and not surprising. And there is somebody who, what's his name, isn't it Mick West? I forget, is it a YouTuber?\n- Yeah, Mick West, Yeah.\n- Yeah. - He debunked stuff.\n- Yeah. I mean, you know, I have since seen some of those videos. I mean, now this is going\nback still at least a year, but some of those videos seem like fairly credible debunkings of\nsome of the optical evidence. And I'm surprised we\nhaven't seen more of that.

I haven't seen debunkings\nof his debunkings, but. - I think there is, but\nhe's basically saying that there is possible explanations for it. - [Sam] Right. - And usually in these kinds of contexts, if there's a possible explanation, even if it seems unlikely, it's going to be more likely than an alien civilization visiting us. - Yeah, it's the extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence principle, which I think is generally true. - Well, with aliens, I think generally, I think there should\nbe some humility about what they would look\nlike when they show up. But I tend to think they're already here. - The amazing thing about\nthis AI conversation though is that we're talking about a circumstance where we would be designing the aliens. - Yeah.\n- And there's every reason to\nbelieve that eventually this is gonna happen.

I mean, I did notice when I was on, but.. - Did you have this concern about AGI, basically the same kind of thing, that we would just look the other way? Is there something about this time where even like World War III, which has been thrown\naround very casually, concerningly so, even that,\nthe new cycle wipes set away? - Yeah, well, I think we have this general problem that we can't make certain information, even, you know, unequivocally certain\ninformation emotionally salient. Like we respond quite\nreadily to certain things. I mean, as we talked about, we respond to the little girl who fell down a well. I mean, that just, that gets 100% of our emotional resources, but the abstract probability of nuclear war, right? Even a high probability, even just, even an\nintolerable probability, even if we put it at 30%, right? You know, like it's just like that's Russian roulette with a, you know, gun with three chambers. And, you know, it's aimed at\nthe heads, not only your head, but your kid's head and\neveryone's kids' head and it's just 24 hours a day and, I mean, I think people who've, this is pre-Ukraine, I think the people who have\nmade it their business to, you know, professionally, to think about the risk of nuclear war and to mitigate it, you know, people like Graham\nAllison or William Perry, or, I mean, I think they were putting like the ongoing risk, I mean, just the risk\nthat we're gonna have a proper nuclear war at\nsome point in, you know, the next generation, people were putting it at, you know, something like 50%, right? They were living with this sort\nof Damocles over our heads. Now you might wonder whether anyone can have reliable intuitions about the probability of that kind of thing but the status quo is truly alarming. I mean, we've got, you know, we've got ICBMs on, I mean, leave aside smaller\nexchanges and, you know, tactical nukes and how we could have a world\nwar, you know, based on, you know, incremental changes, we've got the biggest bombs aimed\nat the biggest cities in both directions, and it's old technology, right? And it's, you know, and it's vulnerable to some lunatic deciding to launch or misreading, you know, bad data. And we know we've been\nsaved from nuclear war, I think at least twice by, you know, Soviet submarine\ncommanders deciding, I'm not gonna pass this up\nthe chain of command, right? It's like this is almost\ncertainly an error. And it turns out it was an error. And it's like, and we need people to, I mean, in that particular case, like he saw, I think it was five, what seemed like five missiles launched from the US to Russia. And he reasoned, if America was gonna\nengage in a first strike, they'd launch more than\nfive missiles, right?",

Maybe we'll not trust any information that hasn't come through specific channels, right.

And, I mean, strangely, I think it may require a greater siloing of\ninformation in the end. You know, it's like, we're living through this\nsort of Wild West period where everyone's got a newsletter and everyone's got a blog and\neveryone's got an opinion. But once you can fake everything. - There might be a greater\nvalue for expertise. - Yeah.\n- For experts, but a more rigorous system for identifying who the experts are. - Yeah, or just knowing that, you know, it's gonna be an arms race\nto authenticate information. So it's like, you can\nnever trust a photograph unless it has been vetted by Getty Images, because only Getty\nImages has the resources to authenticate the providence\nof that photograph and attest that it hasn't\nbeen meddled with by AI. And again, I don't even know\nif that's technically possible. And maybe whatever the tools available for this will be, you know, commodified and the cost\nwill be driven to zero so quickly that everyone\nwill be able to do it. You know, it could be\nlike encryption, but. - And it will be proven and\ntested most effectively first, of course, as always in porn. - Yeah. Right.\n- Which is where most of human innovation\ntechnology happens first. Well, I have to ask, because\nRon Howard the director asked us on Twitter, since we're talking about\nthe threat of nuclear war and otherwise, he asked, \"I'd be interested in\nboth your expectations for human society if\nwhen we move beyond Mars. Will those societies be industrial-based? How will it be governed? How will criminal\ninfractions be dealt with? When you read or watch sci-fi, what comes closest to sounding logical? Do you think about our\nsociety beyond Earth if we colonize Mars,\nif we colonized space? - Yeah, well, I think I have a pretty... - Uh-oh.\n- Humbling picture of that. I mean, 'cause we're still\ngonna be the apes that we are. So when you imagine colonizing Mars, you have to imagine a\nfirst fist fight on Mars. You have to imagine first murder on Mars. - There's also infidelity.\n- Yeah. - Somebody-\n- Extramarital affairs on Mars, right? So it's gonna get really homely and boring\nreally fast, I think, you know? It's like only the\nspace suits or the other exigencies of just living\nin that atmosphere, or lack thereof, will limit how\nbadly we can behave on Mars. - But do you think most of the interaction will be still in meet\nspace versus digital? Do you think we're like living\nthrough a transformation of a kind where we're\ngoing to be doing more and more interaction than digital space? Like everything we've been\ncomplaining about Twitter, is it possible that\nTwitter's just the early days of a broken system that's\nactually giving birth",

And we're continually\nsolving this riddle of what is gonna suffice to\nmake this moment engaging and meaningful and aligned with who I wanna be now and how I want the future to look, right? That we have this tension between being in the present and becoming in the future. And, you know, it's a seeming paradox. Again, it's not really a\nparadox, but it can seem, like I do think the ground truth for personal wellbeing is to find a motive being where you can pay attention to the present moment. And this is, you know,\nmeditation by another name. You can pay attention\nto the present moment with sufficient, you know, gravity that you recognize that just consciousness itself\nin the present moment, no matter what's happening, is already a circumstance of freedom and contentment and tranquility. Like you can be happy now\nbefore anything happens. Like before this next\ndesire gets gratified, before this next problem gets solved. There's this kinda ground\ntruth that you're free, that consciousness is free\nand open and unencumbered by really any problem until you get lost in thought about all the\nproblems that may yet be real for you. - So the ability to catch\nand observe consciousness, that in itself is a source of happiness? - Without being lost in thought. And so this happens haphazardly for people who don't meditate\nbecause they find something in their life that's so\ncaptivating, it's so pleasurable, it's so thrilling. And it can even be scary, but it can be, even being scared is captivating. Like it gets their attention, right? Whatever it is. Like, you know, Sebastian Junger, you know, wrote a great book about people's experience in war here. You know, it's like it can, strangely, it can be the\nbest experience anyone's ever had because everything, it's like only the moment matters, right? Like the bullet is whizzing by your head, you're not thinking about your 401K or that thing that you\ndidn't say last week to the person you shouldn't\nhave been talking about. You're not thinking about Twitter. It's like you're just fully immersed in the present moment. Meditation is the only way. I mean, that word can mean\nmany things to many people. But what I mean by meditation is simply the discovery that there is a way to engage the\npresent moment directly regardless of what's happening. You don't need to be in a war. You don't need to be having sex, you don't need to be on drugs,\nyou don't need to be surfing. It doesn't have to be a peak experience. It can be completely ordinary. But you can recognize\nthat in some basic sense, there's only this, and everything else is\nsomething you're thinking. You're thinking about the past, you're thinking about the future and thoughts themselves\nhave no substance, right? It's fundamentally\nmysterious that any thought ever really commandeers\nyour sense of who you are and makes you anxious or afraid",

                "text": "And the more you discover that, the half-life of all of\nthese negative emotions that blow all of us around get much, much shorter, right? And you you can literally just, you know, the anger that would've\nkept you angry for hours or days lasts, you know, four\nseconds because you just, the moment it arises, you recognize it, and you can get off there. You can decide, at minimum, you can decide whether it's useful to stay angry at that moment. And, you know, obviously it usually isn't. - And the illusion of free\nwill is one of those thoughts. - Yeah. It's all just happening, right? Like even the mindful\nand meditative response to this is just happening. It's just like even the moments where you recognize or not recognize, it's just happening. It's not that, this does open up a degree\nof freedom for a person, but it's not a freedom\nthat gives any motivation to the notion of free will. It's just a new way of being in the world. - Is there a difference between intellectually knowing free\nwill is an illusion and really experiencing it? - [Sam] Yeah. Yeah. - What's the longest you've been able to experience the, escape the illusion of free will? - Well, it's always, it's always obvious to\nme when I pay attention. I mean, whenever I'm mindful, the term of jargon, you\nknow, in the Buddhist, and increasingly, you know,\noutside the Buddhist context, is mindfulness, right? But there are sort of\ndifferent levels of mindfulness and there's different degrees of insight into this. But yeah, so, I mean, what I'm calling evidence\nof lack of free will and lack of, you know, lack of the self, I mean like a two sides of the same coin. There's the sense of being a subject in the middle of experience to whom all experience refers. The sense of I, the sense of me. And that's almost everybody's\nstarting point when they start to meditate. And that's almost always\nthe place people live most of their lives from. I do think that gets interrupted in ways that get unrecognized. I think people are constantly\nlosing the sense of I, they're losing the sense of\nsubject, object, distance, but they're not recognizing it. And meditation is the mode in which you can recognize, you can both consciously precipitate it. You can look for the\nself and fail to find it and then recognize its absence. And that's just the flip side\nof the coin of free will. I mean, the feeling of having free will is what it feels like to feel like a self who's thinking his thoughts and doing his actions and\nintending his intentions. And the man in the middle\nof the boat who's rowing, that's the false starting point. When you find that there's\nno one in the middle of the boat, right? Or in fact there's no boat,\nthere's just the river, there's just the flow of experience and there's no center to it and there's no place from\nwhich you would control it. Again, even when you're doing thing, this does not negate the\ndifference between voluntary and involuntary behavior. It's like I can\nvoluntarily reach for this, but when I'm paying attention, I'm aware that everything\nis just happening. Like just the intention to\nmove is just arising, right? And I'm in no position to know why it didn't arise a moment\nbefore or a moment later or, you know, 50% stronger\nor weaker or, you know, so it's to be ineffective or to be doubly effective, where I lurched for it versus I move slow. I mean, I'm not, I can never run the counterfactuals. I can never, I mean, all of this opens the door to an even more disconcerting\npicture along the same lines, which is, subsumes this\nconversation about free will. And it's the question of whether anything is ever possible. Like what if, this is a question I haven't\nthought a lot of about it, but it's been a few years I've been kicking this question around. So, I mean, what if only\nthe actual is possible? So we live with this\nfeeling of possibility. We live with a sense that, lemme tell you, so, you know, I have two daughters. I could've had a third child, right? So what does it mean to\nsay that I could've had a third child, right? So you don't have kids, I don't think? - No.\n- So- - Not that I know of.\n- Yes. - But the possibility might be there. - Right, so what do we mean when we say you could have had a child or you might have a child in the future.

                "text": "Is there a reality in which non-actual things are nonetheless real? And so we have other categories of like non-concrete things. We have things that don't have\nspatial temporal dimension, but they nonetheless exist. So like, you know, in the\nintegers, right? So numbers. There's a reality, there's an abstract reality to numbers. And it's philosophically interesting to think about these\nthings, so they're not like, in some sense, they're real and they're\nnot merely invented by us, they're discovered because\nthey have structure that we can't impose upon them, right? It's not like, they're not\nfictional characters like, you know, I mean, Hamlet\nand Superman also exist in some sense, but they exist at the level of our own fiction and abstraction. But it's like there're true and false statements you\ncan make about Hamlet. There're true and false statements you can make about Superman,\nbecause our fiction, the fictional worlds we've created have a certain kind of structure. But again, this is all abstract. Like it's all abstractable from any of its concrete instantiations. It's not just in the comic\nbooks and just in the movies. It's in our, you know, ongoing\nideas about these characters. But natural numbers or the integers don't\nfunction quite that way. I mean, they're similar, but they also have a\nstructure that's purely a matter of discovery. You can't just make up\nwhether numbers are prime. You know, if you give me\ntwo integers, you know, of a certain size, let's say you mentioned\ntwo enormous integers. If I were to say, okay, well\nbetween those two integers, there are exactly 11 prime numbers, right? That's a very specific claim about which I can be right or wrong. And whether or not anyone\nknows I'm right or wrong, it's like that's just, there's a domain of facts there, but it's an abstract reality that relates in some way that's\nphilosophically interesting, you know, metaphysically interesting to what we call real reality, you know? The spatial temporal order,\nthe physics of things. But possibility, at least in my view, occupies a different space. And this is something, again, my thoughts on this are pretty in code and I think I need to talk to a philosopher of physics and/or physicist about\nhow this may interact with things like the\nmany-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n- Yeah, like that's an interesting, right, exactly. So I wonder if discoveries in physics, like further proof or more concrete proof that many-worlds interpretation\nof quantum organics has some validity.\n- Right. - If that completely\nstarts to change things. - But even, that's just more actuality. So if I took that seriously-\n- Ah, sure. (chuckles) - That's a case of, and truth is that happens even if the many-worlds\ninterpretation isn't true, but we just imagine we have a\nphysically infinite universe. The implication of infinity is such that things will begin to repeat themselves, you know, the farther\nyou go in space, right? So, you know, if you just\nhead out in one direction, eventually you're gonna meet\ntwo people just like us having a conversation just like this. And you're gonna meet them\nan infinite number of times in every, you know, infinite\nvariety of permutations slightly different from\nthis conversation, right? So, I mean, infinity is just so big that our intuitions of\nprobability completely break down. But what I'm suggesting is maybe probability isn't a thing, right? Maybe there's only actuality. Maybe there's only what happens. And at every point along the way, our notion of what could've happened or what might've happened is just that, it's just a thought about what could've happened\nor might've happened. - So it's a fundamentally different thing. If you can imagine a thing,\nthat doesn't make it real, 'cause that's where\nthat possibility exists. It's in your imagination, right? - Yeah, and possibility itself\nis a kind of spooky idea, because it too has a\nsort of structure, right? So like if I'm gonna say, you know, you could've\nhad a daughter, right? Last year. So we're saying that's\npossible, but not actual. Right, that is a claim, there are things that are true and not true about that daughter, right? Like it has a kind of\nstructure, it's like- - I feel like there's\na lot of fog around . the possibility, right? It feels like almost\nlike a useful narrative. - But what does it mean, so like, what does it mean, if we say, you know, (plastic pops)",

Like it's possible that\nI just threw this cap, but I might not have done that. - So you're taking it\nvery temporarily close to the original, like what would appear as a decision? - Whenever we're saying\nsomething's possible, but not actual, right? Like this thing just happened, but it's possible that\nit wouldn't have happened or that it would've happened differently. In what does that possibility consist? Like where is that? For that to be real, for\nthe possibility to be real, what claim are we making\nabout the universe? - Well, isn't that an\nextension of the idea that free will is an illusion, that all we have is actuality? That the possibility is an illusion?\n- Right, yeah, I'm just extending it beyond human action. - Ah, okay.\n- But this goes to the physics of things. This is just everything. Like we're always\ntelling ourselves a story that includes possibility. - Possibility is really\ncompelling for some reason. (Lex chuckling) - Well, yeah, well, because it's, I mean, so this, yeah, I mean this could sound just academic, but every backward-looking regret or disappointment and\nevery forward-looking worry is completely dependent on\nthis notion of possibility. Like every regret is based on\nthe sense that something else, I could've done something else, something else could've happened. Every disposition to\nworry about the future is based on the feeling that there's this range of possibilities. It could go either way. And, you know, I mean, I know, whether or not there's such\na thing as possibility, you know, I'm convinced that worry is almost never\npsychologically appropriate, because the reality is\nin any given moment, either you can do something to solve the problem you're\nworried about or not. So if you can do something,\njust do it, you know? And if you can't, your worrying is just causing you to suffer twice over, right? You're gonna, you know, you're gonna get the medical\nprocedure next week anyway. How much time between now and next week do you wanna spend\nworrying about it, right? The worry doesn't accomplish anything. - How much do physicists\nthink about possibility? - Well, they think about it in terms of probability more often, but probability just describes, and again, this is a place where I might be outta my depth\nand need to talk to somebody to debunk this, but. - (chuckles) Do therapy with a physicist. - Yeah, but probability, it seems, just describes a pattern of actuality that we've observed, right? I mean, there's certain things we observe and those are the actual\nthings that have happened. And then we have this additional\nstory about probability. I mean, we have the frequency with which things have\nhappened in the past. You know, I can flip a fair coin and I know in the abstract\nthat I have a belief that in the limit, that those flips, you know, those tosses should converge\non 50% heads and 50% tails. I have a story as to why it's not gonna be exactly 50% within any arbitrary timeframe. But in reality, all we ever have are the\nobserved tosses, right? And then we have an\nadditional story that, oh, it came up heads, but it\ncould have come up tales. Why do we think that about that last toss? And what are we claiming is true about the physics of things if we say it could have been otherwise? - I think we're claiming\nthat probability is true. That it just, it allows us to have a nice model about the world. It gives us hope about the world. - Yeah, it seems that\npossibility has to be somewhere to be effective. It's a little bit like what's happening with the laws of, there's something\nmetaphysically interesting about the laws of nature too,\nbecause the laws of nature, so the laws of nature impose their work on the world, right? We see their evidence, but they're not reducible\nto any specific set of instances, right? So there's some structure there, but the structure isn't just\na matter of the actual things. We have the actual billiard balls that are banging into each other. All of that actuality can be explained by what actual things are actually doing. But then we have this notion\nthat in addition to that, we have the laws of nature that are explaining this action, but how are the laws of\nnature an additional thing in addition to just the actual things that are actually affect-costly? And if they are an additional thing, how are they effective if they're not among the actual things that are just actually banging around? - [Lex] Yeah. - And so to some degree,\n- I see, for that,",

So still you have just a local instance of what is actual. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then if it proliferates elsewhere where you can't be affected by it- - Many-world says you can't\nreally connect with the other. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - And so man-worlds is just a statement of basically everything that can happen happens somewhere, right? And that's-\n- Yeah. - You know, and that's, I mean, maybe that's not an entirely\nkosher formulation of it, but it seems pretty close. But there's whatever happens, right? In fact, there's, you\nknow, relativistically, there's a, you know, the\nEinstein's original notion of a block universe\nseems to suggest this and it's been a while since\nI've been in a conversation with a physicist where I've\ngotten a chance to ask about the standing of this concept\nin physics currently. I don't hear it discussed much. But the idea of a block\nuniverse is that, you know, space time exists as an totality in our sense that we are\ntraveling through space time, where there's a real\ndifference between the past and the future, that that's an illusion\nof just our, you know, the weird slice we're taking of this larger object. But on some level, it's like, you know,\nyou're reading a novel, the last page of the\nnovel exists just as much as the first page when\nyou're in the middle of it. And they're just, you know, if we're living in anything like that, then there's no such thing as possibility, it would seem it's just what is actual. So as a matter of our\nexperience moment to moment, I think it's totally compatible\nwith that being true, that there is only what\nis actual and that sounds, to the naive ear, that sounds like it would be depressing and disempowering and confining. But it's anything but. It's actually, it's a\ncircumstance of pure discovery. Like you have no idea what's\ngonna happen next, right? You don't know who\nyou're gonna be tomorrow. You're only by tendency seeming to resemble yourself from yesterday. I mean, there's way more\nfreedom in all of that than you know, it seems true\nto many people and yet the basic insight is that you're not in, the real freedom is the recognition that you're\nnot in control of anything. Everything is just happening, including your thoughts\nand intentions and moves. - So life is a process\nof continuous discovery? - You're part of the universe. Yeah, you are just this, I mean, it's the miracle that the\nuniverse is illuminated to itself as itself where you sit and you're continually\ndiscovering what your life is. And then you have this layer at which you're telling yourself a story that you already know what your life is and you know exactly, you know, who you should be and what's, you know, what's about to happen or\nyou're struggling to form a confident opinion about all of that. And yet there is this fundamental mystery to everything, even the most familiar experience. - We're all NPCs in a\nmost marvelous video game. - Maybe, although my sense of gaming does not run as deep as to know what I'm committing to there, it's a non-playing character? - Yeah, non-playing, oh wow.\n- Yeah. Yeah. - Yes, you're more of a Mario Kart guy, I could tell. - I was an original video gamer, but it's been a long time since I, I mean, I was there for Pong. (Lex laughing) I remember when I saw the\nfirst Pong in a restaurant in, I think it was like\nBenihana's or something, they had a Pong table and that was- - Isn't it amazing.\n- That that was an amazing moment when you... - You, Sam Harris, might live from Pong to the invention and deployment of a super intelligent system. - Yeah, well, that happened fast if it happens anytime in my lifetime. - From Pong to AGI.\n- Yeah. - What kind of things\ndo you do purely for fun that others might\nconsider a waste of time. - Purely for fun. - Meditation doesn't count, 'cause most people would say\nthat's not a waste of time. Is there something like Pong that's a deeply embarrassing\nthing you would never admit? - I don't think, well, I mean, once or twice a year I\nwill play a round of golf, which many people would find embarrassing. They might even find my play embarrassing. But it's fun.\n- Do you find it embarrassing?",

So I just have fun when I play. - Well, I hope there'll be a day where you play around on golf with the Former President Donald Trump, and I would love to be- - I would bet on him if we played golf. I'm sure he's a better golfer. - (chuckles) Amidst the\nchaos of human civilization in modern times, as we've talked about, what gives you hope about\nthis world in the coming year, in the coming decade, in\nthe coming a hundred years, maybe a thousand years? What's the source of hope for you? - Well, it comes back to a few of the things we've talked about. I mean, I think I'm hopeful that, I know that most people\nare good and are mostly converging on the same core values, right? It's like we're not\nsurrounded by psychopaths and the thing that finally convinced me to get off Twitter was how different life was seeming through the lens of Twitter. It's like I just got the sense that there are way more psychopaths or effective psychopaths than I realized. And then I thought, okay, this isn't real. This is either a strange context in which\nactually decent people are behaving like psychopaths\nor it's, you know, it's a bot army or something that I don't have to take seriously. So yeah, I just think most people, if we can get the incentives right, I think, there's no reason why we can't really thrive collectively. Like there's enough wealth to go around. There's enough, you know, there's no effective limit,\nyou know, I mean, again, within the limits of\nwhat's physically possible, but we're nowhere near\nthe limit on abundance. You know, forget about going to Mars, on this, the one rock, right? It's like we could make this\nplace incredibly beautiful and stable if we just did enough work to solve some, you know, rather long-standing political problems. - The problem of incentives. So to you, the basic\ncharacteristics of human nature such that we'll be okay if\nthe incentives are okay? We'll do pretty good. - I'm worried about the\nasymmetry is that, you know, it's easier to break\nthings than to fix them. It's easier to light a fire than to put it out and I do worry that, you know, as technology gets more and more powerful, it becomes easier for the minority who wants to screw things up\nto effectively screw things up for everybody, right? So it's easier. It's like a thousand years ago, it was simply impossible for one person to derange the lives of\nmillions, much less billions. Now that's getting to be possible. So on the assumption that\nwe're always gonna have a sufficient number of\ncrazy individuals or malevolent individuals, it's, we have to figure out\nthat asymmetry somehow. And so there's some cautious exploration of emergent technology that we need to get our heads screwed on straight about. And so like, so gain of function research, like just how much do we\nwanna democratize, you know, all the relevant technologies there? You know, do we want, really, you really wanna give everyone the ability to order nucleotides in the mail and give them the blueprints for viruses online because of, you know, you're a free speech absolutist and you think all PDFs need to be, you know, exportable everywhere? So I'm much more, so this is where, yeah, so there are limits to, many people are confused about my take on free speech because I've come down on the unpopular side of\nsome of these questions. But it's been, my overriding concern\nis that in many cases, I'm worried about the free\nspeech of individual businesses or individual platforms\nor individual, you know, media people to decide that they don't wanna be associated\nwith certain things, right? So like if you own Twitter, I think you should be able to kick off the Nazi you don't wanna\nbe associated with,",

They also discuss the dangers of electing a grossly incompetent and narcissistic person into the presidency, and the need for people in power to be deeply informed, unusually curious, and alert to how they may be wrong. They also discuss the need for honesty and the paradox of how we value authority in science. Finally, they discuss the need for a proper house cleaning of the system, and the need for it to be flexible enough to respond intelligently to changing circumstances.",

They also talk about the dangers of social media and how it can lead to unnecessary controversy and how it can be hard to stay away from it. They suggest that humor might be the only thing that can save us in this new world.

It is noted that life changes can help, but for more severe cases, there are not many good tools available.

It is argued that experts have failed to communicate effectively and that there is a need for a trusted person to aggregate and communicate the truth. The discussion then turns to the Kanye West interview and the need to have difficult conversations in private. It is argued that it is not helpful to give someone with mental health issues a platform to spread their views.
